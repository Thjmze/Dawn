> [!quote|no-t]SUMMARY:At the cave of Hraldag the Wise (Herald), the party successfully returned the sunflower petal, causing the god to grow in power and restore the cave’s vibrant green life. Herald identified their antagonist’s minions as the **Khoda** and revealed that burning offerings of honey, campfire smoke, and cinnamon creates a scent that repels them. He further explained that the "Finger Man" is likely a **Kalashtar** who engineered the Khoda with inherent flaws derived from his own mortal psyche. Following a ritual that successfully restored Beezel’s youth—at the cost of some chaotic wild magic side effects—the party exited the cave to find an ambush. They defeated a shapeshifting stalker who targeted Card (calling her "Achillea") with the help of a mysterious young boy.
> The boy was revealed to be **Ove**, Herald’s follower, who suffers from a de-aging curse that fragments his memory. In a moment of clarity, Ove explained that his father created **15 contingencies** (encoded in recipes and hidden across the island) to stop the Khoda project. By using Errata’s strange, wine-like blue blood as a final ingredient in a ritual involving the cave’s stone tablets, the party reactivated a powerful protective ward. During the process, Nightshade discovered a core memory in Ove’s mind linking him to Errata, suggesting a long-standing connection. As the ritual concluded, Ove’s mind regressed to a child-like state; he clung to Star (in Errata's body) until she sang him to sleep, leaving him safely in Herald’s care as the party prepared to find the remaining contingencies.
