> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY:
> Away from durag dral, two figures named Phenex and Belthor are discussing certain things. Specifically, Belthor wants Phenex to build a second tower of Babel (a tale from the bizzare world he hails from) and challenge the gods. Only she can do it because she is one of the most proficient mages of this era. 
> The festival is about to begin. The first day is when fishers travel to the frozen lake and go ice fishing. Star, Vivi, and Card do not know how to fish (Card does know more bestial fishing), and so was taught how to fish. They got a good haul for the day, and left earlier than usual for it, and so was given enough time to see the evening farmer's market before getting too tired.  In the market, they come across a weaver who uses a material called Milk Silk, a magical fabric with protective properties. Star happened to be very interested in such a thing, and bought it after some consideration with its price. They also find a magical healing fish, which Ellumin also purchased. They consider the dreamcatchers in the market as well, and the party buys a few.  Back at the Watson's house, the party sleeps, however, Card is unable to sleep. JOHANNES and Card are awake past midnight, and notice a crash outside. JOHANNES notices a carriage entering the mountains, the rider hiding their identity. They proceed to wake up the rest of the party, with Star having a nice dream, Ellumin a nightmare, and Vivi, nothing at all. They decide to pursue the figure, with Ellumin and Star going ahead with Vodka.  The first three arrive at the bridge, and while it is very unstable, both Vodka and Ellumin are in danger of falling, but Star levitates Ellumin across. Regardless, the entire party catches up, and see the cave with a pile of dead bodies at the entrance. The party notices that there is an unidentified UMA inside the cave, and choose to retreat.  The festival comes along, and the story blasts through it without too much fanfare. Ellumin and Vivi throw fish at the mayor quite a bit, and so, Ellumin requests access to a locked up ruin from the town, which is granted.  Now, after the festival, the party is escorted to the ruins, and they enter.
