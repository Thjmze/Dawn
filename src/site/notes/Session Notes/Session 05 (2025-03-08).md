> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>Heist planning time. [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico]] reiterates the [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Chain of Acheron\|Chain of Acheron]] is not any ordinary artifact. In the [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Vanyra/Angel's Share/Angel's Share\|Angel's Share]] is the contact for the heist. In addition, anything else they find at the warehouse have free reign to take and sell.
>Upon arriving at The [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Vanyra/Angel's Share/Angel's Share\|Angel's Share]], [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] believes the dragon statue at the front is a weird-looking sheep, much to the dismay of [[Minthe Thistlestep\|Minthe Thistlestep]] and the others, and, entering, find a small group speaking in code to rob the party, which [[Vivienne La Tour \|Vivi]] informs the rest. They find [[Compendium/NPC's/Sozantos\|Sozantos]], who complains about the party to Larry over bar etiquette. [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] look at a lamp in the corner and the vent on the ceiling.
>[[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] makes a plan to contact [[Compendium/NPC's/Sozantos\|Sozantos]] in an attempt to confirm that they are, in fact, the contact. They are, but doesn't trust the party, for being too inexperienced, too weak looking. After telling the bartender a passphrase, we get directions to an underground arena to gain the trust of our contact. After stealing a dagger from that small group, the party peacefully makes their way down the steps to the arena.
>The crowd clamours over Voss, a blacksmith fighter in the arena, who won the fight. The party will participate in the fight, with [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] being the main fighter, and the others as support. After an intense planning session, the fight begins. Card completely decimates the foe, a small kobold, and now bets are open for other fights. The second round begins, and Card fights once again. The orc opponent and their summons continue the fight, all the while [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] continually insults their haircut, as they were being racist to Card, but Card still wins.
>The third fight is much more tough, and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] is downed on the first attack. After a very close struggle, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] survives and barely kills the final foe, a death cultist who chants out to [[UMA Death\|UMA Death]] upon his death.  She has lived through the fights, earned the money, and earned the trust of [[Compendium/NPC's/Sozantos\|Sozantos]].
