> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY:
>The party sees a message that explains a ritual that uses the bodies. Entering the cave,  Card finds a room with a magic circle with some elvish symbols and ashes surrounding it. Ellumin shifts some of the material around with his spear, and even steps inside, but no other affect is visible. He also finds a document that explains the abilities of the creature.
>They travel a bit further and find a boring not-mushroom and a skeleton of a horse, which crumbles to dust. Star decides to sing a Countercharm marching song as the party goes deeper. Ellumin finds mushrooms used for embalming, which the party harvests, and Vivi turns to its embalming product. Zarude notices humanoid bones around the campsite as well. He attempts to date them, and despite all evidence to the contrary, he completely believes it was only a few hours old, which everyone, except Card, does not.
>The embalming powder is made, and is partially applied to Card, Star, and Vivi. The party continues on in the cave, burning webs, inspecting decayed bodies, extinguishing decaying fires, etc. They enter a cliff location, and climb up and around the gap.
>They enter the area housing UMA Decay, and prepare to fight. They snuff out the candles, and fight it. Vodka and Ellumin take first hit, and Card transforms into a dragon. Decay spreads their rot around it and warps away, but the rest of the party take strong swings against it. It kills off Vodka, and that's a bad thing. It also surrounds the island its standing on with a decay DoT. Also a bad thing. While JOHANNES threw a lot of bullets at it, he also falls to it's attack. As revenge, Ellumin and Card makes it fall unconscious. While it attempted to heal itself back up, it still dies. It takes a final blow, and JOHANNES barely stays alive.
