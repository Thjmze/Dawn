> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>In the night, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] enters his memories and meets someone, who, after seeing a memory not in a soul, grants him a boon. Meanwhile, a little bit of worldbuilding is created, on how potions are made. The sigils themselves dilute into the potion, and so the magic activates the sigils upon consumption. Neat. [[Potion-Making Process\|Potion-Making Process]]
>However, this night is no longer a peaceful one, as the town of [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Sapone/Sapone\|Sapone]] is raided by a group of [[gnolls\|gnolls]], humanoid hyena people, as many civilians and soldiers are being killed and eaten. Once the party defends themselves through combat, with some highlights including a nearly dead ally, catapulting one ally into a group of enemies, a human flag of death, and a desperate but failing attempt to break ACLs, we come across the [[Knights Moralis\|Knights Moralis]], and [[Mualani\|Mualani]], an officer whom we met, as well as someone who's daughter has been kidnapped, a blonde woman with a notable scar across her eye, whose name is [[Calysta\|Calysta]]. The [[gnolls\|gnolls]] have taken her to some place unknown, and asks our party to rescue her.
>And so, our party leaves the town, following the path of corpses and blood, to find [[Calysta\|Calysta]], and the [[gnolls\|gnolls]] who kidnapped her. On this trek, we also come to learn of a few more things. The day, July 26, is also known as the [[Night of the Falling Stars\|Night of the Falling Stars]], the summer solstice. On this day, crime rates may have increased, people go missing more often, and yet, festivals are abound at this time. In addition, Ichico and the party make note of something: The gnolls' blood was different. Orange blood. The same is true to the casualties they find along the path, with either a deep, bright red or a light purple colouring of their blood. It is suspected that [[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]] has something to do with this.
>Once the trail of weirdly coloured blood ends, the party decides to head in the direction of the ruins near [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Tolstoy/Tolstoy\|Tolstoy]], an abandoned fortress. Once inside, the party finds gnoll claw marks, seems they were here. We also come to note the fire and light in these ruins, each with uncommon colours, blue, green, pure yellow, and the fire does not burn creatures. A not heating fire (at least the blue one, haven't tested the others).
