> Johannes sensed a lingering presence that manifested by placing an unnaturally heavy, metallic bouquet of flowers in his hand—a floral arrangement of monkshood, pimpernel, and bloodroot. Upon rejecting the gift and shooting at the entity, Johannes was telepathically scolded and his gun was permanently turned pink; later investigation revealed one of his eyes had become a sapphire and he had gained a cowboy-hat-wearing rubber duck made of an unknown substance. During this time, Errata fainted and woke up inhabited by Star’s soul. Star revealed she made a deal with Amaranthus to swap bodies after her original form was taken to a volcano in the east, agreeing to decorate a room for Christmas in exchange for the soul-save while Amaranthus’s "man" creates plant clones named "Tawn." A brief forest fire, ignited by Beezel’s unstable magic, was suppressed by Star’s new Paladin powers and a spell scroll before the party sought refuge in a cozy, warm cave smelling of grilled nuts. Inside, they found stone slabs with offerings of honey and cheese which oozed a bean-scented red liquid when poked; after the halfling survivor tested the liquid and found it delicious, Beezel bottled several vials.
> Deep within the cave, the party encountered Hraldag the Wise (Herald), a black mass with a single eye guarding two fish and mourning the loss of half a sunflower. Through Card’s offerings of a leaf and stick, and Beezel feeding the fish, the party learned of a boy named Ove who created Herald through a wish for love and protection. Ove hails from a village characterized by special bricks and abundant firewood, and he currently uses a fragment of Herald’s power to repel the pale plant creatures that kidnapped Star’s original body. As the party moved toward nearby ruins marked by a giant skeleton, Star felt a northward pull while Errata’s physical body spontaneously regrew its missing finger. After a night of Star experiencing Errata’s old memories in dreams, the group navigated a necrotic, winding forest where shifting vines attempted to drag them down. By utilizing illusions of food baskets and the actual baskets of offerings scattered under the trees, the party managed to trick the roots into parting, allowing them to escape the tangled woods.
