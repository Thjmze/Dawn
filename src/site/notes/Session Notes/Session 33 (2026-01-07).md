[!quote|no-t] SUMMARY: After exiting the cave, the party discovered a +2 dagger that, when fused with a rusted fragment, transformed into the "Promise Blade of Kuutar," a weapon capable of casting Legend Lore. Upon activation, the blade unleashed a disintegration laser that shattered the false cloudy sky—revealing a true night sky and a mysterious woman drinking tea on the moon—before the beam was absorbed. Nearby, the party unearthed a censored, blurry rock containing a metallic tungsten-like sphere, which they extracted after deciphering an Ignan story about a water elemental’s rebellion. At a nearby shrine, they encountered "Steel," a man who claimed to have designed the world's warforged and identified Johannes as an outsider. Steel revealed that the Khoda are artificial beings harvesting divine energy from the races of Nisaba and Rukkadevata, proposing a plan to "poison the well" of their power source. Though the party declined his offer, they proceeded to the purple tree, where they harvested bitter sap and discovered a flaming orb hidden inside the hollowed trunk. By interfacing the stone tablet with this orb, they stabilized it into a teleportation device that pairs with the metallic sphere, granting five charges to travel to the western mountains. After a brief skirmish with small attackers, the party began their journey toward the shimmering blue waters of Amaranthus's base.
