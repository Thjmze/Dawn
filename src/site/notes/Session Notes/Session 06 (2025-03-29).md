>Session 6 Summary  
>The party is given a set of contacts from [[Compendium/NPC's/Sozantos\|Sozantos]] for the heist.  
>Floor Plans -Ida Kitagawa 15% - The notes are more basic, and more so run on intuition. If we do a good job, she'll offer a lower rate of 10%. 
>Juven Hien 15% - The notes are much more comprehensive. However, if we do a bad job, he'll require a higher cut of 20%.  
>Tool Provider
>Baam 10% - It's at a cheaper rate, but we must look for them first.
> Endorsi 20% - Also very reliable in preparation, but at a higher rate. 
>  Expert -Urek Mazino ??% - A dangerous individual, whom we will contact their assistant. How much he will ask is random and unpredictable
>   Sozantos 10% as a commissioner's fee. 
>    For now, the party has chosen Juven Hien for the floor plans, and our meeting with him will occur in a week. They are also considering to go on the hunt for Baam. In the meantime, with the party still considered weak, they must prepare and get stronger. In addition, [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/The Sinners\|The Sinners]] would be hot on their tail, like with the [[WallFacers\|WallFacers]], whom no one knows about. They are told to go to the [[Adventurer's guild\|Adventurer's guild]] to register, as well as a place to stay. The inn that is considered cheap is the party's choice, and was able to reduce the number of rooms to rent to two.  After a long night's rest, and a long cooking session with a fish and herbs, the party arrives at the adventurer's guild for registration. At registration, the party needs to decide on a party name.  And so, they have dubbed themselves the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Sub One Club\|Sub One Club]].  As a test of abilities, they are to undergo a simulation in a lower floor. After going down a ladder hidden in the globe in the guild building, they enter the simulation room, and start the test. In addition, there are mystery panels on the ground.
