>Session 16 Summary:
>The party has now split up the magic items they have obtained from their haul, and are now planning a path to Durag'dral. They decided on using a mixture of horse-drawn and on-foot travel, through the mountain border between Dornfells and Aargenbode. They will take a supply trip to Barovia first, then through the border of The Glass (a frozen lake) and the Cairnhills (a mountain pass), avoiding Ul'Nettr and Ul'Orrek (the fortresses), passing through Voth'Dren, and finally arriving at Ellumin's hometown.
>With a shopping trip concluded in Barovia, claiming a wagon, horses, and a saddle, as well as Star buying a bag of holding which Vivi payed for for herself, they undergo their journey. Unfortunately, they were met with complications, and come to fight a group of gnolls, but are swiftly able to take them down, also meeting Ellumin's horse, Vodka. Card has an advantage in dispatching these gnolls thanks to her necklace of beastly stealth. 
>Afterwards, the necklace handled by Card speaks something ominous in a language none of them know.
