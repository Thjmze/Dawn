>he party started their day with Lyra, learning about the "Slippery Sovereigns" festival which the current mayor, Damien Das, is trying to organize to lift the town's grim mood. They also drank Razlózhnik root tea. In which the townspeople gather and throw fish at the mayor (the mayor takes it voluntarily) because heavy fish (good harvest) won't hit the mayor but fish in a poor harvest will. In times where there is afamine that was not caused by the mayor, only seniors, children, and disabled townsfolk will throw fish. They decided to first help Mary Ann, a former mayor. In return for their help with chores, she told them about the town's deep respect for storytellers, who serve as oral historians since written records are rarely kept. She spoke fondly of a deceased storyteller, Kaelen, and expressed concern over Privy, who, after Kaelen's death when she was 16, became the town's sole storyteller and began insisting on a strange new burial rite on Skarn Mountain. Privy has been storytelling since she was 14. The old burial rite was about burying someone closer to their family, this one is about burying them in a warm cave on the Skarn mountain. Star uses her battlechef knife to melt snow, whilst Johannes and Ellumin chop then light wood (using a divine smite). 
>The party visited Privy's suspiciously well-kept home. While she was occupied, their investigation uncovered unsettling clues. Her bookshelves contained manuals on mimicking human behavior, and Ellumin found transcripts of Kaelen’s old stories stained with a greenish, copper-like substance. When Privy returned, she told her story about Skarn Mountain in a soothing, mother-like tone, framing death as a peaceful release.
 > Ellumin cast Zone of Truth, but Privy refused to answer questions about her identity. When cornered, Johannes shot her legs, revealing teal-blue blood (copper instead of Hemoglobin). Privy immediately committed suicide. After Ellumin triggered a hidden alarm, the party did a final search. Johannes discovered the real Privy's childhood journal, revealing she'd vanished after heading to the mountain as a teenager. Ellumin found a hidden space between the walls packed with barrels of gunpowder and unlabeled vials of liquid. They also found Tinkers tools, a census including details on health/how much a person will be missed, a vial of water, multiple copies of one outfit and mold infesting a plant. 
 > To cover their tracks, the party used the gunpowder to blow up the house, making the alarm seem like a call for help from a fire. During the chaotic escape, Johannes was burned by the blast. The party then retreated under cover of invisibility to the safety of Mary Ann's house.

The Party awakens and eats a breakfast that Lyra prepares for them as well as Razlózhnik root
tea. Ellumin tells Star and Johannes about a tradition in the town in which the townspeople
gather and throw fish at the mayor (the mayor takes it voluntarily.) In times where there is a
famine that was not caused by the mayor, only seniors, children, and disabled townsfolk will
throw fish. During this conversation, Lyra tells the party about Mary Ann, a former mayor, and
the current mayor. She tells them Mary Ann may need help with some household chores.
The party decides to visit Mary Ann first, as Ellumin knew her personally as a child. He does not
remember where Mary Ann lives, but they get there after asking some people for directions.
When they arrive, she greets them and invites them in. The party introduces themselves and
Mary Ann inquires about their travels
Mary Ann: How are your travels?
Star: It was cold. It was okay, but it was really cold.
Mary Ann: Oh, did you not take the train?
Star: No, we walked here. Well, we did a bit of it on horseback, but it was mainly walking.
Mary Ann: Oh? Why?
Star, knowing that she can’t tell Mary Ann that they’re wanted criminals and that the train would
be too risky, responds:
Star: Oh, you know. Just for fun.
Mary Ann laughs and accepts the flippant answer as simply the quirks of adventurers. She
sends Johannes and Ellumin to move some boxes into the work room while she asks Star about
her origins - where she’s from and what religion she practices. Star answers all these questions
honestly. She never mentions that her religion and hometown actually do not exist in this world,
because Mary Ann never asks.
She then asks the party for help with clearing snow outside and chopping firewood. Star uses
the Battlechelf Field knife’s fire abilities and slices up the large snow pile, melting it with ease.
Ellumin noticeably sucks at chopping wood. Johannes excels at it. It’s too cold for Ellumin to
light the furnace with his tinderbox, so he uses divine smite to light it.
Mary Ann thanks them when they’re finished, and they all sit once again to have Elderroot tea.
She talks about a half elf story teller named Privy, who has some odd opinions about burials.
Generally, the tradition in the town was to bury dead loved ones under the house, so they may
always be close. For Mary Ann, she says her religion states that people should be buried close
to the sky. However, Privy seems to be insisting that all bodies must be buried on a specific
mountain: Skarn Mountain. Skarn mountain is not particularly tall nor short. It's in the middle of
the road - of average height. However, Privy is insistent that it is “the only place where the souls
will feel warmth”. Star comments that if the mountain were the tallest in the area, then it would
make sense for Privy to think that as it would be closest to the sun. However, because it’s of
average height, she isn’t sure what to make of it. Mary Ann comments that she misses a
different story teller named Kaelen, whose stories were drab but still comforting.
Ellumin asks Mary Ann more about the story tellers in the town. We learn that Privy has been a
storyteller since Ellumin was born - roughly 20 years. Around that time, she became the town’s
only storyteller. She was a storyteller before, but 20 years ago, Kaelan died and no one has
replaced him and so she became the only one. Normally there are two to keep some
competition. Shortly afterwards she started telling of a different burial rite which made use of an
unnaturally warm cave. It’s not warm warm, but it noticeably always stays just above freezing.
And now in recent times, all the burials have since been done there. The hunch is that this is
related to the pervasive cold which has fallen over this town - that the ratio of burials being done
there has caused a shift. We are unsure whether Privy’s intention is to prevent the freeze from
worsening, or whether she is attempting to cause it. In either case, we need answers from her.
The party decides to visit Privy. Ellumin wants to keep things civil, but he is not against this
becoming an interrogation, as she clearly has information that no one else knows and that we
need.
Privy lives in a noticeably big house. Apparently, Storytellers are actually treated better than
mayors because they are the primary historians - without them, the town’s identity would
basically be gone. Thus, it’s a very well respected occupation. Privy comes from a family of
storytellers, so it makes sense she lives well. Written records aren’t commonly kept in this town.
Upon a thorough investigation, it is a normal house. A tripwire can be seen, but it’s just a typical
burglar alarm: It’s a normal house. Ellumin casts a divine sense: again he finds nothing. Ellumin
prepares his spear and steps over the tripwire so he doesn’t set it off.
They knock on the door and it swings open on its own. Being cautious, Star knocks on the
doorframe and calls out: “Hello, miss? May we come in?”
Her voice echoes throughout the house, echoing back before Privy appears. She recognizes
Ellumin and greets them. She apologizes, stating she isn’t hosting any storytelling nights
tonight.
“That’s alright,” Ellumin says, “but if you have the time, we were interested in one particular
story.
She invites them inside and they sit at the dining table. She is visibly walking strangely - in a
way that is not caused by injury. Privy apologizes that she doesn’t have any food prepared and
excuses herself to cook them something. Before leaving, she invites them to explore the dining
room and living room. However, she asks them not to go upstairs: “private business, I’m sure
you understand.”
With 45 minutes to themselves, Ellumin examines the dining room and the living room.
Curiously, in the dining room, there is a piano in the corner. It’s visibly not used often, collecting
dust, however it’s odd that it’s in the dining room and not the living room. There are two sets of
drawers as well. However Star hesitates to rummage through them, as she feels it’d be bad
manners.
For the living room, it looks as if she hasn’t had many people over - like a showroom. Like it’s
more for decoration rather than living in. It’s used more as a business room - the room where
she holds her storytelling nights. It has a desk, bookshelves, couches and an armchair and a
fireplace, and most notably, a giant globe by the back wall. One bookshelf has a lot of instruction
manuals such as books about social etiquette, and parenting books. The other bookshelf
contains more non-fiction, but it’s increasingly strange. One in particular is specifically a manual
on how to operate a specific type of machinery that notably would not be stored or utilized in a
home nor would it be used in her line of work as a storyteller. There are also: acting guides
about micro expressions, guides on how to talk to people, many books about general anatomy,
as well as Census books - books of all the people in Durag Dral.
Ellumin, noting the many books about social etiquette and anatomy. She appears to be putting
much effort into studying human behaviour and etiquette. One can be socially awkward, but this
is a lot. This combined with her strange gait makes him think that Privy is not who she says she
is, or perhaps is no longer who she is - that she’s been replaced. The plan is to ask about the
Skarn mountain story about the burial grounds and to keep an eye on her. If everything checks
out, we stay civil. If there are red flags, we interrogate, and if it escalates, Ellumin will cast Zone
of Truth.
In the desk, Ellumin finds a book with various stories written down. It’s not common for stories to
be written down here, but there are a few in this book. The pages have some green spill stains,
similar to the color of oxidised copper. Ellumin recognizes the stories in the books are transcripts
of Kaelan’s old stories.
Note: Kaelan is more of a self starting Storyteller rather than one from a family of storytellers like
Privy, so his house would not be as nice as Privy’s.
The party refrains from entering the second floor as they were specifically forbidden there, and
refrain from entering the bedroom as Privy only gave them permission to access the living room,
dining room, and bathroom. Thus, the search ends.
Privy returns with fish-based dishes and they begin to talk. The party requests the Skarn
Mountain story. When she comments that Ellumin would have heard the story dozens of times
growing up, Star jumps in and says she wanted to hear it and Ellumin explains he can’t
remember enough details to tell it to her properly.
When Privy tells the story, she is very calm, her tone is akin to a soft mother soothing a child.
Privy has always changed her tone of voice based on the type of story - a strength she had over
Kaelan, who always told every story in the same voice.
Generally, the story is as follows:
“You know the cold of life, don't you? It’s not just in the wind. It's the ache in your back after
hauling the nets. It's the splinter in your thumb from chopping wood. It’s the sharp word from a
neighbor, the worry for tomorrow's catch, the fear of being forgotten. That coldness, we carry it
within our hearts from when we are born till when we die.
But the mountain... The mountain offers a final warmth once the body has passed.
When it is time for someone to go home, we do not weep for their journey. We envy it. Once
they are resting on the warm mountain stone, the wind that bit you at the docks here only
whispers here. It stops trying to steal your heat and instead begins to carry away your burdens.
With every step, a worry falls away. The argument you had last week? Gone. The weight of your
years? It lifts. You feel lighter. Quieter. The soul becomes at peace with the life it had lived.
And then you reach the cave.
The moment you step inside to deliver the body, you understand. There is no fire, but a warmth
blossoms deep in your chest. It’s a peace so profound it feels like coming home after a lifetime
away. It is the warmth of letting go. But the living should not stay there, it is the domain where
the dead can finally be at peace.
When we lay a body down upon the stone, it is not a burial. It is a tucking-in. We are returning a
tired child to their cradle. You can see it on their faces. The lines of worry smooth out. They look
more peaceful than they ever did in life. They are not dead; they are simply... finished their toil
on this realm so they may pass into the next wherever that might be. Their story has been told,
and they can no longer make altercations to the tapestry that is their life. They don't need to
worry about silly things, they can just rest. And for those of us who make the journey and come
back down? We carry a spark of that warmth with us. A taste of that perfect quiet. It’s a promise.
A reminder that no matter how cold life gets, a gentle, welcoming peace is waiting for us all. So
we must march up there to bury our dead, for if we don't, we only prolong the suffering of the
deceased as their soul continues to be trapped inside their body.”
The story is weird. So weird and creepy in fact, that Ellumin and Johannes are tempted to jump
to casting Zone of Truth as soon as it’s done. Johannes feels that it’s almost hypnotic. Ellumin’s
Divine Sense and Detect Magic still have not detected anything.
Ellumin Casts Zone of truth. Privy fails the Spell save dc.
Ellumin asks, “Are you who you say you are?”
She begins to get up to try to leave the circle, and he signals Johannes to point his gun at her,
freezing her in her tracks.
Privy: “you come into this house, the house of a story teller, beg me for a story, and dare-”
Ellumin: “answer the question.”
Privy: “Is my body not of a storyteller?”
Star: “Is your mind of a storyteller?”
Privy continues to avoid answering the question directly.
Ellumin: “are you, Mind, body, and soul, Privy?”
Privy does not answer.
Johannes and Ellumin are standing at the entrances to the dining room and roll intimidation. It
works, because the sight of two very tall built men standing at the only exits of the room, one
armed with guns, is very scary.
“...Fine. what do you want to know?”
“Who are you?”
“Have I not been clear in my answer?”
Finding that the “who are you” line of questioning is not working, Ellumin asks, “what has
befallen this town?”
Jyo: “Everyone roll initiative.”
Everyone: “Fuq, WHAT?”
Privy runs to the corner where the piano is, jamming herself against the wall so she’s just barely
out of the zone of truth, and reaches behind the piano.
Jal: “JOHANNES ROLEPLAY THE AMERICAN POLICE FORCE”
Kara: “SHOOT HER JOHANNES SHOOT HER-”
Johannes shoots both of her legs. Both her kneecaps explode. Her blood is a teal blue. Similar
to the green stains in the book. Johannes uses an action surge and walks over to her, grabs her,
and tosses her back into the zone of truth, in the center, on the dining table. She grabs a knife
she set out for cutlery, jamming it into her throat and up to her skull, killing herself and ending
the fight.
Star loots her body and finds that she’s not carrying anything one would typically carry in
everyday life, such as keys or the like. Upon closer inspection, she isn’t even wearing
undergarments - she’s wearing clothes, but that’s it. As if to mimic human behaviour. Ellumin
and Johannes investigated the piano to see what she was reaching for. They find a button on
the wall. Ellumin presses it.
There is a loud alarm that rings through the entire house, and they hear a smoke signal being lit.
The entire town would know that something is up with the storyteller. It makes sense the
storyteller would have these alarms in place, as there are people who would want to silence her.
Now that Privy is dead, The party splits up to investigate the rest of the house. Johannes enters
the bedroom and finds a plant with mold in it, a potion vial with water in it, tinkerer’s tools
scattered about the desk, and a single leather bound journal. Skimming through it, he finds it’s a
census, different observations of people - such as how often people usually get sick, how many
family members they have, and how much people would miss them. In the chest by the bed,
there’s multiples of the outfit she was wearing - Green shawls, traditional storytelling uniforms.
Nothing else. She only has the one outfit, everyday. Hidden deep in a corner, he finds another
journal, and this one is filled with nearly illegible writing. It’s the handwriting of a child - written by
the real Privy when she was thirteen, talking of how boring Kaelan’s stories are, and that she
could find better stories if she went out to explore. She talks about how her parents refuse to let
her explore the mountain. She talks of how she admires Kaelan for being well liked, and how
she wants to explore the world and make her own stories. Because she has a talent for telling
stories, but she’d rather tell stories she’s experienced herself, instead of the same stories all the
time. The final entry details a day where her parents aren’t home.
“Today is the day I’m going to do it. I’m going to sneak out, and find a story worth telling.”
Ellumin explores upstairs and finds that it’s mainly underdeveloped. He looks at the walls and
compares the interior to the outside. The walls are noticeably smaller than they were on the
outside. He finds nothing suspicious: storytelling notes, and presents she may have received.
He takes a dagger and tries to cut open a wall. He runs the blade across, cutting through it.
There’s a strange, grey and smoky smelling powder on the tip of his knife.
Johannes and Ellumin dig their blade into the wall and manage to wedge it open. They find
barrels upon barrels and vials upon vials. The grey powder comes from a barrel that ellumin
stabbed when he stabbed his blade through. The vials are filled with an unknown liquid. Star
offers to fill her waterskin with the powder so they can investigate it when they leave. Johannes
and Ellumin take two vials each.
The powder in the second floor is most likely gunpowder Ellumin and Johannes decide to blow
up the house, so that when the townspeople saw the Smoke alarm, they’d think “oh, she called
for help because her house caught fire,” and not “Oh, she called for help because people are in
her house.”
Ellumin and Johannes drag Privy’s body to the kitchen, and turn on all the gas burners. Ellumin
wraps his returning spear with cloth, lights it, and walks down the hallway. He launches his
spear back at the stove. As soon as the fire begins to spread, he returns his spear back to him,
and books it out of the house.
The house shakes and explosions ring out as they rush out of the house. The fire spreads
quickly, and Johannes gets burned a bit. Star and Ellumin make it out unscathed. The
townspeople can be heard in the distance. They entered and left Privy’s house through the back
door so the townspeople haven’t seen them yet. Star casts invisibility on everyone and they
sneak away. Johannes and Ellumin are good at covering their tracks as they go, Star not so
much. They return to Mary Ann’s House.
