> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY: The session began with Card being held at knifepoint in a tavern by a muscular individual who says, "You know, you’ve got a whole lot of guts walking into a tavern like this one while having an active bounty on your heads. Tell me, do you want to come out alive or dead because the sinners offer rewards for both."
>  To de-escalate, the party pretends to be a theatre troupe studying for a performance. Star claims their wanted posters are inaccurate, casting JOHANNES as "Jonathan," a retired soldier and newfound father to her character, "Clarissa." The cover story is met with skepticism and accusations of racism towards a tiefling and a thri-kreen. A hobgoblin in the corner, unimpressed and displaying prejudice against Warforged, suddenly stabs "Jonathan," who plays dead. Despite their friend's apparent "death," the party maintains their cover story, with Star even cussing out the hobgoblin.
> The party leaves the tavern with the hobgoblin and two other mercenaries. Once outside, JOHANNES immediately gets up and sucker-punches the hobgoblin, whose retaliating knife breaks. The party then attacks the three mercs. Beezel and JOHANNES go for low blows, Vivi chases down an invisible opponent named Henry in a Julius Caesar-style attack, and Star and Card defeat the third, William, with Card landing a fatal blow.
> Looting the bodies, they find earpieces on the hobgoblin, a Cloak of Billowing on William and Henry, and a magical shield inscribed with the motto of the Iron Shadow.
> Shortly after, a mysterious, high-level figure approaches and hands Beezel a sack of gold before the hobgoblin is taken away, surrounded by powerful magic. A guard from the city, whom the party recognizes, rushes out, shouting "I won’t let you take another body." He attacks the woman but is easily repelled and slammed against a wall, breaking his chest. **It was only after she saw him slammed against the wall with his chest broken that she began to hyperventilate and wretch, then teleported away.** The guard is identified as Command Sergeant Smith of the 41st Division. The party helps the injured Smith back to his home to rest.
> At Smith's house, he passes out. The party makes themselves at home, sleeping in various spots. Beezel inspects the sack of gold from the mysterious woman and finds 30 deep crimson gold coins imbued with undispellable Abjuration magic. Exploring the house, Vivi finds family photos of a single father with his two tiefling children. Star discovers an Argenbodian military uniform and rifle in a trophy case. In the study, Beezel finds a corkboard with missing person posters connected by string to various local vendors: one to the tavern, one to a blacksmith, three to a fruit seller, and six to a hotel on the edge of town. There is also a list of graduates from the Dornfels magic institute from the past three years, as well as a list of its current and former royal mages. The last name on the mage list has its current location marked with question marks, as if the person is missing.
> The session ends with Sergeant Smith waking up
