> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY:The party returned to the wizard's tower, where she returned JOHANNES' upgraded gun. Sergeant Smith interrupted the meeting, revealing the wizard's true name is Amaranthus, the "mother of gnolls," and attempted to arrest her with an anti-magic field. Amaranthus easily escaped and initiated a time stop to speak privately with [[caer-dineval.png\|caer-dineval.png]]
> During the time stop, Amaranthus revealed Card's true name, Achillea , and her own true form (six eyes and four arms). She explained the true origin of Tieflings: they were not cursed by demons, but were mortals who practiced "theophagy"—the consumption of divine flesh from dead gods. Amaranthus then pointed out that Star has unknowingly absorbed the flesh of a dead god. To "accelerate" this, Amaranthus reached into Star's chest and forcibly grew a "seed of darkness" already coiled around her heart.
> After the encounter, the party met with the queen , who begged them for aid and invoked the Dawnbreaker Protocol—an international agreement for global threats. She tasked the party with exploring a new island, Horeye, offering cleared bounties as a reward. They have a 14-day time limit before a "disposal team" arrives.
> The party boarded a ship and met Granny Nightshade (Gertrude). On the voyage, JOHANNES spoke with his patron, UMA Death, who tasked him with killing individuals on the island seeking immortality and confirmed UMA Decay is a fragment of her power.
> The voyage was disrupted by the sound of fighting below deck. A Wild Magic Surge then blasted the ship, causing Beezel to age decades instantaneously. Hearing the words "Lazel Erko", the ship began to descend rapidly. The party jumped to safety , landing on the island as their ship crashed. They received a psychic "help" from a nearby woman , while Star felt an unnatural warmth. After the party gave the woman food, she carved a diamond into her arm, said "debt," cut off her own finger, and gave it to Card.
