>1. Session 13 Summary:  The party is given a week from Baam, who will have a meeting with Sozantos. Upon arriving in Barovia, Zarude is hit with a deep sense of dread, a heavy weight on himself, even remembering his fallen village, while the rest of the party has a lightened sense of such.  They enter a house to the south to meet up with Sozantos, and everyone except Card got bitten by their cat. Baam and Juven arrive, and the meeting begins. Sozantos mentions the Sinners being a connected to the train sabotage, from former members of the Iron Shadow. Juven and Sozantos begin briefing them on the heist.  There are 90 minutes in the heist. Each round takes 1 minute. The informants may have died. Three assets are given: the radar, the teleporter, and the bags of holding. In addition, the water supply has been sabotaged, narrowing the guard's perception. Vivi is given a disc (the teleporter), to warp the party to her location. The caves are lined in labradorite, highly reactive, and mineable. If crushed, they can do minor healing. The base of the mineral can be broken off cleanly. The paths are fragile, and may be prone to instability, and cave-ins. The labradorite also mutated creatures within the cave, and is advised to avoid it. Along the river, the deeper waters may have some extra predators. Past the cave, security is tighter. Up to 9 Arcane Eyes act as stationary security cameras, where cold and psychic damage can stop them for a minute (one round). While one camera's destruction may be negligible, multiple are seen as a concern. Inside, are a few chests, covered by arcane eyes. There are also locks with a puzzle minigame. The compound also has traps. The center of the compound has a room to clear some of the cam footage. If the party reaches the vault in 30 minutes, they  will get the gold, as well as (2x+30)% of the gold they retrieve. In the exit, we collapse it as we leave, the device being given to Card. In the vault, all doors are specially locked. Certain keys are made, which is a maze minigame. One is a blind-leading minigame, and the other is a swapping maze, with a key inside somewhere.  In the end, we'll have disguises and fake IDs to avoid detection.  Star asks if Sozantos is impressed with the news. He isn't, but it was his fault to have expectations in the first place. Baam has another favor. The other entrances have been sealed, so the party would need to take some of the Sinner's explosive supplies, somewhere east of the town.  After leaving the house, Card, Zarude, and Vivi take money from the fountain, and a witness sketches them. Vivi takes and burns the book, and flees, while Star and JOHANNES stay in the theatre and have some tea.`
