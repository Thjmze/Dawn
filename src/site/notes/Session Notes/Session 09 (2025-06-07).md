Mechanics
#### Scene: Entrance
You enter a cold office building, the walls are worn down from years of use but the furniture itself seems in stark contrast to the rest of the room. 


#### Scene: Initial talks
"I owed Sozantos a favour and he asked me to take you folks in to rob this joint. If it wasn't for him realizing the Dornfells Vault was a sting operation by the Knights Moralis, I would've been toast. For crimes like ours, they would've erased your memory till you barely know who you are anymore. I'm sure he's already impressed on you that this isn't a petty venture but I'll reiterate. The sinners ain't the ones one should be messing with. If I had a connection for every single person that has died trying to break into that vault alone, I'd have built an information network even larger than the one I have now. "
* Here I prepared an old map of the joint. This is from when it was first designed and I want you to walk me through how the hell you would break in. 
* Things to remark: so how are you planning to get past em? For the first guards. Remote control drone 

##### Mechanics:
1. There is a clock that goes up by 1 minute after a combat and for every non-combat action you take. You will trade in minutes for the amount of money you steal from the vault. 
2. The alert level determines how fucked you are. As you heighten the alert level, you will encounter more obstacles such as increased guard patrol, more traps (some of which cannot be detected) or reinforcements who arrive at alert level 3 but do not actively know your location until Alert level 4. 


# Heist Mini-Game Mechanical Summary

---

## 1. **Approach Structure**

- **Two main approaches:**
    
    - **Bottom Up** (3 sequential choices)
        
    - **Top Down** (3 sequential choices)
        
- Each approach consists of **3 choices (tokens)** with 3 possible numerical values each (low, mid, high).
    

---

## 2. **Token Values**

- Each choice is associated with three possible token values representing the quality or cleverness of the plan.
    
- Tokens are drawn from predefined sets (e.g., Cave: 2/3/5; City Catacombs: 5/7/8; etc.).
    

---

## 3. **Skill Checks to Unlock Tokens**

- Skill check **DC = 13 (Moderate difficulty)** recommended
    
- Players roll relevant skills (Stealth, Athletics, etc.) to reveal and activate tokens
    
- Failure to activate a token means the pathway/token is lost (cannot be used)
    

---

## 4. **Turn Economy**

- **Each token requires:**
    
    - **1 turn to reveal + 1 turn to activate**, or
        
    - **1 turn to gamble activate blindly (no reveal)**
        
- **Recommended turns per player:**
    
    - **4 players:** 4 turns each (total 16 turns)
        
    - **5 players:** 3 turns each (total 15 turns)
        
    - **6 players:** 3 turns each plus extra turn (total ~18 turns)
        
- Turn management encourages balancing risk vs safety (gamble vs reveal)
    

---

## 5. **Outcome Thresholds (Cumulative Token Sum)**

### Adjusted for approx 20% best success:

|Outcome|Bottom Up Threshold|Top Down Threshold|
|---|---|---|
|**Best**|Sum ≥ 17|Sum ≥ 16|
|**Acceptable**|Sum 12 – 16|Sum 11 – 15|
|**Worst**|Sum ≤ 11|Sum ≤ 10|

End of Planning: Okay so you'll need a fair bit of equipment

Need Magical Decrypter 
Choose 3
-  You'll need a selective magic reuptake inhibitor 
-  Need a way to knock out guards
-  Trap/Radar detector
-  Radar upgrader
-  Poison Water supply (extra time)
-  TP portals 
-  Sabotage Alarm Systems (extra alert levels)
- False Decoy 
-  Bigger bag
