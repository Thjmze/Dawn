>1. The heist begins. The bomb is ignited, and blows up an entrance to the cave. JOHANNES leads the way deeper, but Card, Ellumin, and Vivi go ahead into the waters. A creature comes up and attempts to feed, holding up the party, except for Card, who waits for them to catch up at a locked door.  Inside the building now, the party navigates through the traps and Arcane Eyes while Vivi attempts to gain some extra loot, alerting the system a number of times. Urek also goes inside and investigates a further room, and Ellumin goes deeper, activating another trap. Star tries to deactivate the study's cameras (with a bed roll), while JOHANNES does so, and the party catches up to Ellumin.  They enter a blinding room, smelling of sulfur, and pass through, but not without Star's candle causing an explosion, and the guards now on alert. They come around the corner, and JOHANNES alerts to their location through a camera. A fight breaks out between the party (+ Urek) and The Sinners, and now on a rush to the vault. Taking down the first guard swiftly, Urek and JOHANNES focus in on the tankier second one, with the others pitching in.  The session ends with the party approaching the vault.`
