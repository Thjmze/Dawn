> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY:A halfling, claiming to be the last brother of Mayflower, came sprinting off a cliff in a terrified state while clutching a briefcase. As the party intercepted him, Beezle heard ominous crunching in the distance, and Erratah—who can now speak in two-word phrases—confirmed the approach of a vine-like monster. The creature, characterized by unnaturally pale skin and a target on Sven and Star, emerged from the ground and spoke in a Primordial voice that reverberated off Sven, asking, "Where are you?" A chaotic combat ensued where Vivi and Card landed several strikes; however, the creature possessed horrific regenerative properties that allowed it to shrug off damage. Despite its resilience, the party’s use of Web and Minor Illusion proved too much for the beast, forcing it to unravel its vine-like form and metamorphose before fleeing the scene. Inside the halfling's briefcase, the party discovered a broken antique radio, a survival kit, a journal, and a stone tablet that acts as a triangulation tool for distances and origin points. Card also recovered ten perfectly spherical rocks from the stash.

> In the aftermath, the party realized Star had gone missing, likely kidnapped by the pale attacker. Erratah noted that while Star is in danger, she feels a strange sense of connection to the creature. To make matters worse, something new and unfamiliar has begun watching the group. Thanks to a successful history check from Granny, Nightshade recognized Johannes’ reacting watch as a tool used by a child-eating cult to enter the Dark Hour. During this revelation, Nightshade’s ring attempted to strike a deal regarding the cult, leading her to remove the ring entirely to silence the voice within. The dying Mayflower brother remains with the group, desperate to leave the island, though his prospects for escape remain grim.
