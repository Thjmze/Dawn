>Session 17 Summary:
>After the fight with the gnolls, the party continues on their journey, and come across a group of people, planning to cross the train tracks through the night. They might have recognized them, but Star doesn't remember. In the night, Vivi notices the stars moving on a vortex, forming a ball of light in the sky. While it is still small, it falls a bit, and detonates, spreading the particles outward. Afterwards, Ellumin notices a faint light in the distance from the camp, leaving Zarude to keep watch while he investigates. He finds a fragment of something, and sees a memory contained within. He sees a city, a sadness, and writing a letter. He sees a fight between a man and another group of people. He hands it to Zarude, who also sees it.
>The next day, Vivi recognizes it as the memory of Mico during the fight with Untoast, and is the crystallization of that memory. Star holds onto it, and also remembers, following by an attempt to eat it, but it disappears before she should eat it properly, but gets some extra temporary power. When cleaning up the camp, Ellumin notices a wanted notice of the party, for the assassination of six important figures across the regions. The group that camped with the party gives them a bag of chocolate beans, and travels together with them for a day.
>The next day is a small blizzard, and the party chats a bit. The party suspects the group of other suspicious activities, and Ellumin and Vivi starts asking for their occupations. They recognize the party as a group of fellow criminals, and Ellumin convinces them that the party has robbed a criminal organization called the Last Stand. Now that night has fallen, the party attempts to travel past the tracks.
>The guards are stationed in the area, but Ellumin takes the wagon with Card and Zarude to get past the tracks when Zarude made a small fire at the cabin, while Star uses her invisibility and Vivi takes advantage of the fire to sneak past.\
>They camp out in a building past it, and find another memory fragment. Card picks it up this time, and finds the memory of someone doing research on 30 separate points of the night sky. Vivi also sees through it, and sees that they are in some ruins in the desert. Another fragment is found by Ellumin, much smaller, which simply gives him energy. Star eats the fragment that Card held, and casts mass healing word onto everyone, including the horse. Ellumin finds old elven text on the wall, which Vivi decodes, talking of the past civilization and a descender.
 The party arrives at Ellumin's hometown, and the stables. He calls out Loran, and asks what the situation is, but is ignored and dismissed, due to the presence of the rest of the party. He meets up with his sister, Lyra, and also gets an update of the situation. Trading caravans have not been arriving, and the wildlife is uncooperative. The party heads into the reading room, but while Ellumin talks with Lyra, he finds that something ticked off his divine sense, but nothing else immediately afterwards. Ellumin heals their grandfather, Rayn, and wakes up, alike a deep freeze, but is unable to heal it in its entirety. He gathers the rest of the party to dinner.
He mentions to the party about an unnatural amount of cold in his grandfather, and they guess as to its origins. They then have a conversation with Lyra, and introduces themselves. Lyra talks about the cold sweeping over the village. Ellumin asks for Privy, a storyteller, and her whereabouts, but it held off for the night, when Lyra has a moment of awkwardness with Card, where everyone retreats in their own way. Star and Vivi notice the snow ferret that is with Lyra have a moment of clarity, who attempts to flee, before being caught by Lyra, who hands a bowl of chili to Card, as an apology, and hands other bowls to the other party members.
As Vivi returns, she notices that the animals do not like being in the vicinity of the town, like an instinct. Lyra prepares a room for the party, and they rest for the night.
