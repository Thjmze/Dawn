The session opens on two mysterious women at a black table in space, surrounded by clouds. They look down upon the world. The sky behind them is different, containing nine orbs wrapped in elegant, chained writing. A golden orb ripples and unleashes a bolt of yellow lightning. One woman parts the clouds to reveal the land of Durag Dral, and the lightning strikes someone below. The other woman, who was inking a scroll, casts a spell in an attempt to wipe the memory of this event from those who witnessed it. She says to her companion, "Sister, the seals are showing signs of fray, and humanity is running out of time. Maybe they'll be able to help."
Down below, the party is with Ichico, planning their trip to a nearby island. Their conversation is interrupted by a hologram of a white wolf pretending to attack them. Under the cover of a forcefield (Leomund's tiny hut), Ichico delivers the message "Donâ€™t trust anyone with a platinum ring engraved with a copper snake." and informs the party of the organization offering criminal clemency if they stop a storm in the ocean. The party decides to travel to the city of Dol'Savik first.
Along the way, a chirping sound emanates from Card's backpack. It's a sending stone, with Lyra on the other end, calling to inform them that a delegation is arriving in a few days. The party assigns travel roles: Vivi is the forager, JOHANNES the scout, and Star the guide. They soon encounter a strange fog filled with flumphs and wild magic surges, where they meet Beezle Buzzer, a small, bug-like Wild Magic Sorcerer. He is searching for his steed, a giant toad named Sven. Star successfully finds Sven and befriends him. The group decides to camp with Beezle for the night to wait out a blizzard.
During his night watch, JOHANNES discovers red blood dripping down his arm. He opens his hand to find a platinum pocket watch with a copper snake insignia. Strangely, the watch face has 13 hours instead of 12. The party investigates the blood; Beezle tastes it and confirms it is humanoid, disproving Star and Card's theory that it came from a yeti.
After the blizzard, the party, now joined by Beezle, is drawn into a large fight against a yeti, frost wolves, and another monster.
Having survived the battle, they finally arrive at Dol'Savik, paying an entry fee to get inside. They find lodging at a place called "The 63.5 tavern." As they sit down, the session ends on a cliffhanger: a knife is pressed to Card's neck.
