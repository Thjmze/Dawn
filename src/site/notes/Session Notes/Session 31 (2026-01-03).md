> [!quote|no-t]SUMMARY:The high-stakes rescue mission commenced with the party splitting into extraction and retrieval teams. While Nightshade and Star navigated the treacherous lava island, Nightshade discovered a connection between the stone tablet and the terrain, spotting ominous glyphs surrounding the central waters. Deep within a collapsing mountain platform, Nightshade located Star’s original body partially submerged in a hole. The "Finger Man" attempted to bribe Nightshade with a Robe of the Archmage to abandon the party, but she refused, leveraging her own secret pact and hidden true name. As the villain monologued and unnaturally reassembled his severed fingers, Nightshade seized Star's body and initiated a frantic retreat. Johannes triggered a precision Earthquake, collapsing the volcano and plunging the antagonist into the rising waters. However, the victory was bittersweet: Star’s retrieved body remains in a critical, unnatural state—her blood has turned forest green, her veins pulse violently at the mention of her name, and a teardrop-shaped brand has appeared on her forearm.
>  In the sky, a massive circle of yellow fire formed into a watchful eye with a diamond-and-dot pupil, representing a debt or promise and searching for the group. As the party fled through illusionary terrain, Vivi diagnosed Errata’s soul as "drowning" within the body. After Beezel force-fed Errata the mysterious red liquid, the stone tablet underwent another transformation, turning from metal to wood and gaining two new tally marks. Guided by a mental map gifted by Amaranthus, Star led the exhausted party through a forced march—leaving Card and Johannes suffering from exhaustion—to reach a hidden lake. After crossing by raft and returning the sunflower to Herald, they located a sanctuary that appears as a simple cave but contains a magically hidden interior. Inside, the party continues to stabilize Errata, who has only managed to utter the word "Blood" as the vengeful "Finger Man" continues to hunt for his "project" and the finger he lost in the chaos.
