When the candles were lit, the stone tablet underwent a metallic transmutation, glowing with primordial text that read "Contingency Measure 3/12." After Beezle successfully interfaced the tablet with a nearby hole, the air filled with ozone and revealed a hidden, leaden puzzle box. Despite the box’s complex three-stage transmutation lock, Nightshade successfully picked it to reveal a bizarre, intricate recipe for lobster tail—a creature long extinct in these waters. Leveraging a surge of magical power, Beezle flew the party toward the eastern volcano, passing a massive shield wall and a hidden village before reaching a mountain range littered with the skeletal remains of primitive dragons and an ancient red dragon. At the summit, they observed a serene pool filled with bodies—possibly including Star’s original form—guarded by the same "man on the mountain" figure from Star’s memories who creates clones from severed fingers to brew a Potion of Life.
> Shifting focus to the southern volcanic region, the party discovered rocks etched with primordial hieroglyphics depicting a king, a golden ankh, and anachronistic Industrial Revolution technology like milling machines and toasters. Within a nearby crevice, Beezle encountered fire elementals struggling to handle a metallic bouquet containing the missing half of the sunflower. While Card and Mirielle attempted to negotiate in Ignan—learning that the elementals sought to denounce a figure named Kuutar—the situation devolved when the elementals refused to surrender the flower petal and a sentimental locket. Nightshade intervened by hypnotizing the elementals, allowing the party to seize the sunflower petal, the locket, and 375 gold before fleeing under the cover of illusions. Though the theft caused significant friction within the group, identification revealed the sunflower petal to be a "Trinket" imbued with the energy of a dead god, used as a seal. Now, fully rested and utilizing soul-links and wind-walking magic, the party is preparing a high-stakes extraction plan involving invisibility and dimension doors to steal Star’s body back from the volcano.
