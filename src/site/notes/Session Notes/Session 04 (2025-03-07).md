> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>We recuperate  the way back to [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Sapone/Sapone\|Sapone]], and meet ufp with [[Calysta\|Calysta]]'s father who requested help. He thanks us, and points to the capital up north for resupplies of [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]]' revolver ammo, since the bullets are fairly advanced for the setting. [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico]] suspects something about [[Laika Spades\|Laika]], and intends to report to the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Union\|Union]] about it. She leaves the party for their own devices, saying 'the records aren't right'
>[[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] has a great desire to get a stuffed animal. She asks the gate guard patrolling the upper area where the toy store owner is to buy one. Despite her desperation, asking the guard didn't help as he informs her of how insensitive/crass her actions were considering the recent tragedy that just occured. She comes back to the inn. 
>[[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] follows [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico]] for a follow up on what she's saying. He is informed that [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico]] is also not of the current realm, in a sense. Asking for an explanation on [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/UMA\|UMAs]], [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] learns that despite [[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]] dying, there is still colour in the world. That is because Colour is a [[Master Rule\|Master Rule]], where, despite dying, the concept that they represent continues. There are also the [[Superior Rules\|Superior Rules]], a being above Master Rules, like [[UMA Death\|UMA Death]], which perpetually exist. Ichico has further claims that, under [[King Irmin\|King Irmin]], there is no [[arcane geometry\|arcane geometry]] researcher named Laika, and so something must be up with this individual. UMA Colour could not have killed a body in such a way, and talks to JOHANNES about her findings.
>[[Vivienne La Tour \|Vivi]] and [[Minthe Thistlestep\|Minthe Thistlestep]] go out for inventory cleanup, and find extra scraps outside the gate. Vivi asks Minthe on trying to create a specialized grappling hook, and talks about how focusing is really hard.
>The next day, [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico]] brings the party out to a ship to leave to the nearest Union base, near [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Vanyra/Vanyra\|Vanyra]]. Unfortunately, the shopkeeper is swindling the party, but [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] is very scary, and brings it up to the captain, who is also doing business. [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] is less scary this time, but did get a discount on the fare. The party then travels the rest of the day to [[Arcan Gate\|Arcan Gate]], but doesn't stop there, and makes for [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Vanyra/Vanyra\|Vanyra]].
>The party finds a group of bandits from a crime organization called the [[Sinners\|Sinners]], and they converse about finding a date for a gala. Also something about the [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Chain of Acheron\|Chain of Acheron]] and the transportation of said artifact.
>They skip camping with the bandits, and arrive near [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Vanyra/Vanyra\|Vanyra]], entering the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Union\|Union]] base, a tower. In the interim, some members proceed to make sleeping arrangements featuring one person on one queen-size bed, and the party everywhere else. After a short tour of the tower, and a completing of the Quest, we come to track an artifact, the aforementioned [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Chain of Acheron\|Chain of Acheron]], on rails along the route of [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Jadagarr/Jadagarr\|Jadagarr]] on the train called the [[Snowpiercer\|Snowpiercer]], owned by the [[Sinners\|Sinners]]. Also, they are currently holding onto basically all of the healing potions. A lot of people have been used as livestock to harvest more potions. They are the ones who are producing it.
>The party now has a new mission: stealing the [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Chain of Acheron\|Chain of Acheron]] from them. The [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Union\|Union]] cannot interfere directly, but the party, being 'technically' independent, can. They are given a safe-ish route, a more risky route, and a very risky route. Route one, Train Heist, break in, reap havoc, leave. Route two, warehouse. Much stealthier, more elite foes. Route three, gala. Even more rewards, even riskier foes.
>After some discussion, it eventually was decided that the second route, the warehouse, was the route to go. The party is given a point of contact to a shady tavern to begin.
