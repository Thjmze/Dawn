> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY: > Sargent Smith wakes up, drinks a bad-tasting paralysis potion from a glass vial, and seems uncoordinated. He says **Phenex** ("Fedex") will likely go after *him* (Sir Smith), not the party. He reveals a conspiracy board, stating Phenex "makes no sense" ("for all intensive purposes") and claims to be the first female mage, though there's no evidence. Smith recalls a story that shadows (especially in Aargenbode) kidnap people who walk alone at night, and supposes the Sinners torture these victims to create healing potions—which he believes Phenex was doing. 
> Phenex's nails are noted as being sharpened and the same color as Beezel's coins. Johannes finds his memory of her altered (recalling a "powerful necromancer"-esque feeling), though he remembers more than most. They also recall her panic attack. 
> Smith's connections send the party to a magic shop owned by a woman named Marie. They almost get scammed, but Beezel and Star negotiate for various items. Marie directs them to meet Idiya Otte, a magical items crafter, warning them she’s "not one for chatter or company." 
> They return to Smith and update him on their plan to leave for **Jadagarr** after a nap. Johannes, still not fully recovered, checks his pocket watch but finds no changes ("pocket watch fuckery"). Smith is hesitant about them traveling to Jadagarr, as it's "bounty hunter heavy" (Dolsavic is housing many people). He explains the Sinners are specific, strong groups named after Solomon and his book, "The Key of Solomon." Smith offers a connection to **Queen Galina Petrov**, who is part of the "Dawnbreaker Protocol," an alliance trying to stop "the storm." This protocol can't outright *remove* their bounties, but can *reduce* them to stop them from being hunted 24/7.
> While walking to meet Idiya, they pass a cave and hear the words "hell" and "cauldron" in Sylvan. Star throws a rock of light, spotting a humanoid creature rushing back in. Star calls out (her voice changing unnaturally), and Beezel finds the cave "weird." Star throws another stone, revealing a feral humanoid in a cave full of mirrors. The creature approaches, shoots, and hurts Star. Beezel fires a warning shot, and the party leaves. 
> They find Idiya's building in the snow. They enter, call out (no answer), and the lights turn off. Idiya appears. Vivi attempts conversation. Johannes produces his gun; Idiya snatches it, makes him pinkish, and fires at the ceiling. Johannes tackles her and retrieves the weapon. Idiya says she can upgrade the gun with cold magic, but she requires a **Winter Wolf Organ** for the component. As *payment*, she also demands the **entire frost salamander** for her "reasons." Idiya also investigates Beezel's Wild Magic, triggering a surge. She reveals she has her *own* Feywild shard (kept secret in her hand) and offers to help Beezel. She also turns Card's soap into a battleaxe of warning and identifies Johannes's shield as "speedy." Vivi spots something shimmering outside. 
> Idiya directs the party back to the cave they skipped. Beezel transforms Card and Star into T-Rexes. Inside, they find the frost salamander and a "homeless winter aladrin." The eladrin casts a sleet storm, blinding most, but Johannes and Vivi attack him. The T-Rexes kill the salamander. The eladrin escapes the cave, shoots at Beezel (who is shielded), and is then killed by Vivi's knife. They examine the eladrin's body, noting weird eyes, throat, and feet, and extract the eyes. 
> **Phenex** ("Fedex") suddenly appears, freaking people out. She controls the eladrin's body, gives the party money, and teleports away with the corpse.
