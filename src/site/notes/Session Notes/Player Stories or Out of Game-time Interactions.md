> [!NOTE]-  Star's Eulogy/Tale for Ellumin
> Elluminn Watson was a boy who was grew up in the town of Durag Dral, with his grandfather and his younger sister Lyra. They grew in the shadow of his father, who cared for them the best he could but was frequently absent due to his military duties. Thus, Ellumin acted almost as a father to his little sister, caring for her until leaving for military services.
> As he grew, he became more and more ambitious, eventually leaving for military services, following in his father’s footsteps and becoming a soldier. He travelled the world, helping those in peril, and frequently buying souvenirs and trinkets for Lyra.
> On one of his adventures, he happened upon a group of adventurers who were being attacked by a group of thugs. He intervened, assisting in warding off the bandits, and thus making new friends and joining the adventurers.
> However not all can be peaceful forever. In the time of his absence, The Monster of Decay arrived and hid itself in the Mountain Skarne, unleashing a thick miasma upon the town, freezing the townsfolk and permeating decay.
> His grandfather was particularly affected, with the cold freezing his limbs and clouding his mind. He remained sickly for many a day, scarcely able to sleep, to eat, or to speak. he became lethargic and frail, in a manner which shocked and alarmed Lyra.
> Thus, Ellumin returned to Durag Dral with his new friends, after receiving a plea for help from his sister. The battle was long and hardy, and ended with them defeating the beast. Upon its death, the misfortune and despair was lifted from Durag Dral. His Grandfather recovered quickly, regaining his vitality.
> However, the aftermath of the battle caused the destruction of mountain skarne. a horrible avalanche arose and tumbled down toward the town. To save his hometown from ruin, Ellumin used the last of his life force , channeling all his divine power to shield the town from the avalanche. In protecting the town and the people from being levelled, Ellumin lost is life, sacrificing himself for Durag Dral and his family. He was a protector to family, a trusted ally to friends, but to the town, he was a hero.

> [!NOTE]- All The Good Soldiers Are Dead: Card's rememberance of Ellumin 
> All The Good Soldiers Are Dead:
> A person is sitting beside a fire, knees to their chest as they hum a quiet tune from a
> quaint village that’s long been destroyed. The voice is gentle, the voice is kind, and their
> voice doesn’t fit Card at all. Yet still it comes from her throat, smoothly and softly as if
> it’s long been imbedded into her nature. A nature that some people hated.
> Card never really liked Ellumin, and she never really felt safe around him either. From
> the moment he joined the party she was always cautious around him, always keeping a
> distance. How could she not after everything she’s been through. How could she not 
> when even her friends didn’t even think she was safe around him. No, not her friends from the party, her other friends.
> "Achi I don’t trust him”
> “Achi you have to get away from him”
> “ACHI HE’S GOING TO HURT YOU”
> Their voices were loud, but only to her. They were so scared for her, scared throat
> Ellumin would hurt her the same way they got hurt. But he never did anything to her.
> Because at the end of the day, despite everything and everyone that told her he wasn’t good, there was one thing she couldn’t truly deny.
> Ellumin was a good soldier.
> And all the good soldiers are dead.
> Card still remembers the day Ellumin asked the party to help him save his village. Her stomach churned at his words, and yet despite that, she agreed. How could she not.
> Even if Ellumin’s presence felt like a knife to her throat, that wasn’t enough to justify her compliance in the deaths of peaceful townsmen. Those innocent people. They didn’t deserve to die. Especially from such a quaint village. It was then she decided tohelp. To prevent a destruction much like her own.
> Ellumin was a good soldier.
> And all the good soldiers are dead.
> She supposes that’s why she’s alive. Because unlike her, Ellumin was strong enough,
> Ellumin was good enough to save his own people. Even at the cost of his life. And Card?
> Well, there’s a reason she’s here, and not them.
> Ellumin was a good soldier 
> A better soldier; than she was. 
> And all the good soldiers are dead. 
> Now she sits here, in front of a fire, humming a quiet tune from a quaint village that’s long been destroyed. She thinks back to Lyra. The grief in her eyes was all too familiar.
> The expression on her face was all too familiar. And the hug she gave her was all too foreign. But Lyra will get through this, because if she’s anything like her brother, then her strength breathes the same way he did.
> Ellumin was a good soldier 
> Ellumin was a good Paladin 
> The only good one she knew.

> [!NOTE]- A Night Without Light: Vivienne's memories of Ellumin
> A Night without Light
> Vivi sits down with a sigh. It's a cold night.
> She's outside Lyra's house, on the night the mountain blew up. The air moistens around her breath, a cloud puffing out every few seconds. She watches it, a white puff blowing out, fading away into the stars. The speckles are dotting around the night sky, the brightest one right outside the window, a lamppost burning its fuel on the porch.
> She's crying up a storm right now, and there's nothing I can do about it. Not me. Not anyone, really. Maybe Star could help. She's positive minded. Though, I'm not sure how she's taking it. I heard this is her first ever adventuring party. She even named it. The Sub One Club, huh? From what I remember from Star's words, it's always about being less. Less of one entire thing. One's sanity? One's being? One's life? Never got an answer from her. I don't think she would. Not right now anyways. She's busy comforting Lyra, trying her best to get her to relax a bit. Card is as well, but, whatever comforting words there are, I doubt Lyra wants to hear them right now. It'll hurt. A lot. The fighting duo is gone. Zarude left on his own once again, another mission, another time. JOHANNES, on the other hand? He said there's something important going on, and left early. Maybe it's for the best for Lyra. Being surrounded by the people that were with him in his final hours must hurt.
> I saw everyone's faces today. I saw Zarude, his expression a mix of nostalgia and pain. JOHANNES was as stoic as ever. Ellumin...
> He was a bright person. He wasn't a ray of sunshine, like Star. He's not the sun. He doesn't light up one's day with their presence. No. He's... like a guiding star. Pretty small, and not a lot of light to him. But he's always there, always present, and always shows others the path forward. I feel that's who he was to Lyra. To us.
> Vivi thinks back to the last few minutes with Ellumin. The avalanche was already approaching, and the entire party was running away. However, Vivi watches. She always does. And she saw Ellumin's face. The pain, the fear, but most importantly, the resolve. She saw him stop, take a step, and turn around. She knew what he chose. And she knew that some people would never accept it.
> She snaps back to the present, and hears the muffled sobs and words of condolences behind the window.
> Star cried quite a bit already. She really wears her heart on her sleeve. I'm sure she would have cried even harder if it wasn't for Lyra also crying.
> Card. Didn't know. She was so confused. Do I tell her? Do I not? How do I break it to her? How do I say that everything is okay?
> Had I known I'd go through such pain, I wish I had never met them. If only I never saw it in the first place, I wouldn't feel this sad. This lonely. Of course it's a lie, and of course there's a lot of positives in their life. But it doesn't stop you from feeling that pain. That loss. That loneliness.
> Back when I lost it all, what did I want? What was the one thing that someone could have done to help me learn?
> What were the words that I wanted to hear?
> Nothing.
> In this world, you can hear the tales of losing a loved one every day, from bard's tales to quests about a family. It's a relief when you find someone who can articulate their own feelings and write beautiful songs, but those are that person's words alone. The moment I'm convinced by these words, it feels as if my own thoughts are overwritten... and that scares me.
> So I need some alone time to face those things. My thoughts. My memories. My own feelings. Because they don't belong to anyone else but me.
> And that's why, when people are feeling sad, they should be there. On their own. It's their story. No one else's.
> She looks up at the sky, once again. The stars shine ever more into the night, but, she can't help but feel a little lost.
> She sighs once again. It's certainly a cold night.

> [!NOTE]- A short conversation with Ellumin by Vivi
> Ellumin was curious.
> He is currently sitting in a wagon set for his hometown. Card is currently not in the area, scouting ahead for possible routes through the mountain pass, while Zarude and JOHANNES left for the mountaintops, mentioning something about "training". The small lightning bolts through the air has himself questioning about how this would constitute 'training', but he'll let it slide. They just went through a harrowing event recently, maybe some time to their own devices was good in its own right.
> Ellumin decided he would keep watch of the wagon, since Star has decided to take a nap in the meantime - perhaps she had a moment of motion sickness, and couldn't get any proper rest yet. Though, right next to her was the person whom Ellumin was currently curious about - Vivienne la Tour, a fellow half-elf who, seemingly, was the leader of this party before he and Zarude showed up.
> Ichico gave him the rundown of this group before they arrived - a group of adventurers that came from another world entirely, where magic is inherent within every individual, and is not crafted, like the soldiers he used to work with. They were always eccentric, each one with powerful abilities, and powerful personalities attached. He especially remembered a combat medic who was also a necromancer - they could only revive the dead, so they always brought a gun to kill their patients before reviving them. He wondered if this other world had eccentric people like her - if Vivienne was one of them. She always had an infinite supply of glowing daggers, maybe she was a conjurer? Though she did mention she can't use magic. Ever so curious, her power. At the very least, she was dependable, a good quality in leadership, and an anchor point of stability with the group he finds himself in. If it came to guessing the actions of the rest of them, he felt he could relatively predict her actions, at least to some extent.
> Oh, he must have been stuck in his thoughts, as Vivienne is now looking at him. The paladin was still vigilant of his surroundings, of course. One can never be too careful of the dangers around them. But he must have been looking over in Vivienne's direction more than usual, since it appears she is aware of it.
> "Do you do this often? Keeping watch, I mean."
> Vivienne has a curious look about her, like a cat that has entered their new home. She might be trying to engage in some conversation, getting to know each other better. They have done a lot of fighting, and a lot of plans, but conversation was somewhat uncommon ever since they met.
> "Yeah, I could always trust my own judgement more than anyone else's."
> "Oh, you were in the military then, is that correct?"
> "Yes, I was. Vanguard special forces."
> After a moment, her head cocked to side, and Ellumin remembered. Right, other world. She probably doesn't have a grasp on his world's military structure.
> "It's the very front lines of the army. The ones that push the borders, and are usually an offensive force."
> "Oh, I see. Did you like it?"
> There was a pause. Him and the military - it's a complicated relationship, to be sure. His men put their trust in him, and their entire squad was considered one of the best, and he took some pride in that. The people he fought with were his brothers-in-arms, and they were genuinely good people, with genuinely good beliefs. But, to those that aren't on the field, war is a game of politics and favoritism, not fighting, and he didn't much enjoy that. It felt like him and his comrades were just pawns in a game where they had to put their life on the line, just for the sake of someone else's pride, power, wealth. It felt disgusting.
> His expression must have soured quite a bit, since Vivienne asked something else before he could answer.
> "Were rogues common? Like, did you meet up with them?"
> He supposed rogues of a military background were different from the adventuring sort. She is most likely trying to expand her field of knowledge in the craft.
> "There's not much to say, really. I talked to them fairly often. They always had some intel that was useful in our operations. But, as for the specifics, you might have to ask someone else. I only really know what I have to, so that I can interact with them."
> He recalled the moment after they boarded the train. He tried to get a grasp of Vivienne's intentions, since it seemed she found the terrorists before they launched the attack, but at the same time, it also felt she was riding the chaos that the rest of the group were undergoing. Only afterwards did she ask about specific military signals she could use, the way he communicated with the intelligence network. She mentioned something about the 'dialect of a language', so perhaps she used something similar in her world. 
> Vivienne sneezes after Ellumin's statement. Since they are traveling closer to the northern lands, the climate is much colder than the forests before. He recalled holding onto the fur blanket for Vivienne, stuffed into his backpack. Taking it out, he throws it onto her, covering her head and body, and slightly overlapping Star's torso as well.
> "It'll only get colder from here, so you better get prepared."
> He wasn't worried about the others as much from the climate. JOHANNES and Zarude went to the mountaintops, so they would figure it out, and Card had a natural affinity for warmth. Star was always bundled up nicely, but Vivienne dressed only half as much. She might have a similar constitution to her sister, or her sense in fashion is simply on the warmer side. Regardless, Vivienne planned accordingly, asking him to hold onto the blanket.
> "Yeah, I should have gotten used to chaotic weather, but I guess long-term cold is different from short-term extremes."
> "What does that mean?"
> "Well, you know how I can make those berries?"
> "It certainly saved us on costs, I remember them."
> "The magic is supposed to come from a place where such weather is common. You could have a blizzard where you stand, while a heatwave is going on a few steps away. It's that kind of place."
> "I thought you said you couldn't use magic."
> Vivienne's face scrunched slightly, her head tilted to the side, as if she's trying to explain something for the first time.
> "Well, I never had any real talent in magic. But, supposedly, my mother had some of it in her, so I had the potential for magic. But, apparently, my mana circuits got really messed up before it could develop, so I think these berries are just about the best I can do."
> "What about those knives? The glowing, purple ones? They seem quite powerful."
> "Oh, those? Apparently, it's not magic." She whispers something under her voice. "At least, that's what Mirielle says..."
> "Mirielle?"
> "Oh. You heard that. Uhh, just think of her as someone I know, and leave it at that."
> Ellumin raises up his hands in acceptance. "It's alright. I won't pry into your matters if you don't want to."
>Though, that wouldn't really stop him from wondering, even as the rest of the party regroups and continues on their journey. Does this 'Mirielle' know how she uses her 'magic'?
>Ellumin was still curious.
