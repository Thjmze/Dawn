> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY:
>Zarude looks up at the sky in a vision, and notices a large circle forming, striking purple lightning at himself and the party, though no evidence of this event seems to be noticed by anyone.
>Regardless, Lyra and the rest of the party grieves back at the Watson household (minus Ellumin) for them to calm down and process the situation. Vivi silently comforts Star, while Zarude gives his condolences to Lyra, and suggests the village's (older) funeral rites. Zarude gathers the party together to prepare for it.
>Lyra asks who knew the party was entering the mountain and where Ellumin's body is, and they mention the mayor and his bodyguards knew, and they tell the general location of Ellumin. Soon the Aargenbode royal envoy  would arrive to investigate the situation, and the Sub One club decides they can let the mayor report on what they did. Star heals the grandfather and returns to good health. In introductions to him, Card reveals that their real name used is Achi (Ah-kee).
>There are currently two plans of action for the rest of the day: Create a story for the town, and find Ellumin's body. Star decides to stay behind to draft a story for the storytellers, while the rest search for the party. After some triangulation from Vivi and searching efforts from Zarude and Card, they find Ellumin, completely preserved. They send it to Mary Anne's house, who takes it temporarily until the funeral, and translates the note they had on UMA Decay.
>They return to the Watson household as Star obtains details on Ellumin's childhood with Lyra. After getting everything else organized, the next day, Ellumin's funeral begins. Star tells a story about Ellumin, and his journey up until his death, which the townsfolk accept. With that, they travel back to the house and do a private funeral. Vivi and Star plant Vivi's flowers, Zarude buries the first coin they earned together, and Card hands Lyra Ellumin's dreamcatcher.
>As the party leaves, Zarude's vision comes true, and golden lightning strikes him. It feels like he is being sucked out of the plane, and lightning marks and tiny clocks cover his body, which no one can see. Zarude's time has shifted in spurts, speeding up and down at seemingly random intervals.
>On their travels, Ichico returns, emotionally exhausted, and the party is now officially affiliated with the Union, but, the Sinners know of the connection between the heist and the Union, and Ichico got the brunt of the consequences of that. She calls out that the party has a hefty bounty on their heads, and it can be removed if they travel to a newly formed island in the south and destroy it. She mentions travelling to Dol Savik, to teleport to Jadagarr, and then teleport closer to the island.
>Ichico mentions Mico, and determines to fight against the Sinners for killing her daughter and delivering the head in a box.
