>2. Session 15 Summary:  The party continues the fight against the guards. Card took a nap, but at least Zarude still exists. After beating them all up, JOHANNES finds a hidden room from where one of the guards showed up from. Zarude takes the gold within, and the party arrives at the vault room. After taking the maze breaker from Card, Star attempts to disable the maze, while clockwork hounds (the security system) chase after the her (metaphorically).  The party then searches for the Chain of Acheron within. JOHANNES searches the dining table and armor statue, while Ellumin searches through divinity and Star licks the turkey made of resin on the dining table. JOHANNES finds a potion, Ellumin specifically looks for magic, and Star breaks the turkey. Upon breaking the dining table, Star finds the Chain of Acheron, though something happens to Star. It is unknown what it did, however. JOHANNES enters a bedroom and finds a series of love letters from Laika (the wife of that one guy in the UMA Color place), with a desire of power.  Meanwhile, Vivi heads to the storage room and gathers a bunch of magic items. Ellumin also gains a number of magic items in the side room.  An alarm is sounded, and the party leaves through a tunnel, on a (somewhat) successful heist. They eventually surface, and Vivi sees a creature out of the air, dropping off Ichico. They hand off the chain (and mention the possible consequences of Star) and walk inside of a safe house. She congratulates them, and mentions the help to get the group home.  Ellumin mentions that he has family up north, but something is happening.`
