> [!quote|no-t] Session 10 Summary:
> Star asks Juven on how we could find Baam. We get a card with his visual, and a suggestion to get to the black market and get some favor. Before we could leave, though, a small group of hobgoblins that belong to the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Iron Shadow\|Iron Shadow]] ambush Juven and the party in an attempt to kidnap [[Juven Hien\|Juven Hien]] for information. The party meets Ichico's subordinates, the half-elf oath of watchers paladin, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Ellumin Watson\|Ellumin Watson]], and the human storm sorcerer, [[Zarude\|Zarude]] who join the battle by breaking in through a window and pickpocketing a fleeing hobgoblin in the streets. The fight was a brutal one with Johannes splattering one person's brains all over the room, hellfire based teleportation and so much chaos. They decide to head to the inn to stay the night. The inn where the receptionist now thinks there has been a breakup in the group but they are now monogamous with new partners. Another round of convincing the innkeeper to keep two rooms, one for the girls, the other for the guys.  
> They begin heading to the black market in which  they use [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Electrum\|Electrum]], used for a lack of tracking. After unlocking and relocking the gate, the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Sub One Club\|Sub One Club]] enters the tavern. Zarude insists on charming the tavern keeper, Mary, for some information, but fails, and is calmed down by JOHANNES as she had believed the party to be undercover members of the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Knights Moralis\|Knights Moralis]]. After ordering drinks, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] asks about where Baam might be. Mary hands over a partially filled bottle of Doramek mountain whiskey that [[Baam\|Baam]] had left behind, and suggests heading to the herbalist for possibly more information. The herbalist Maomao speaks about Baam's recent actions, in a very poetic manner. He desired to live in a cabin by the sea, but Maomao believes it is his lifestyle in the mountains where he has acquired the green scent of treants that should be changed. She also provides info on one of her remedies that allows for a shorter long rest, as well as one of the herbs in making it being Rimegrass, and another contact, the leatherworker Grok. He mentions getting myconid skins (who only reside in deep dark forests where not even light permeates the bottom layers) from Baam , which came from the eastern woods, and Pleiades' magic shop might know more.
> Pleiades, a dark skinned human woman,  mentions him asking for a couple items that changes along with its wearer's size, and Avarice the Sinner being someone he might be trying to avoid. The alchemist had Baam buying something for an unstable Polymorph, as well revealing he had dirt, sand, and rocks on his boots suggesting far travel. Taylor the tailor mentions Baam getting undersized clothing for himself, and a postcard on ancient elf territory, called[[The Glass\|The Glass]], or the [[Mirrors of Self\|Mirrors of Self]]. She also sells Star a dress for 100gp that comes with built in padding thus increasing her AC to 15 while noting how poorly dressed [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Ellumin Watson\|Ellumin Watson]] is.  At the information broker, the party asks about Baam's whereabouts. After losing a lot of gold from a game called [[Deathroll\|Deathroll]] which originated in [[pintops\|pintops]], he informs the party that he disappeared with a postcard to [[Everwhite Tower\|Everwhite Tower]] in the 29th of July, with his personal belongings, and disappearing in August. Another item is the business card of [[Ahmed Noke\|Ahmed Noke]], and a collection of yarrow flowers which are only considered to grow in the Northern Forests. Baam's most likely location, based on the evidence, is within the Svalich Woods. So, the party departs to the forest. The party decides to take a trip to this forest via the train that goes from [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Jadagarr/Jadagarr\|Jadagarr]] to a place near the [[Svalich Woods\|Svalich Woods]].
