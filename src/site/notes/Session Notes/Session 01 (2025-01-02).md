>The story begins at the aforementioned [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Lore In Campaigns Past/portal\|portal]] of our party's primary realm starrting [[Minthe Thistlestep\|Minthe Thistlestep]], [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]], [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]], [[Vivienne La Tour  \|Vivienne La Tour  ]]], and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|"Wild Card"]]. All of them were contacted in some way or another during the [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Lore In Campaigns Past/Nexian Portal Crisis\|Nexian Portal Crisis]] by different parties and asked/ordered to come here with the notable exception of [[Vivienne La Tour  \|Vivienne La Tour  ]]. When they see many people seemingly unable to enter the portal, including some very powerful individuals, they decide to try and get in. A nearby guide tells them that the goal is to just enter the portal and see what is behind the crisis. It should be very brief and not at all dangeroius.
>They come into this new world [[Earth\|Earth]] but in doing so they feel a [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/strange dark force\|strange dark force]] grip their hearts and squeeze it. They come into contact with their first foe, a man who claims to be a [[negator\|negator]] with the power of [[UnToast\|UnToast]]. The party does not fully understand this concept yet.
>After a swift defeat of this foe, a member of the [[Knights Moralis\|Knights Moralis]] named [[Mualani Ibarareth\|Mualani Ibarareth]]  confronts them and is about to apprehend one of them for doing an act of [Forbidden Magic]. They meet [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico Nemuri]] who appears to be an ally. 
>To stop this, she asks her daughter [[Mico Vorgeil\|Mico Vorgeil]] to cast a memory erasure [[Spell\|Spell]]. Once they escape they are told of [[Sol\|Sol]] and his influence on the World. Through various apocalyptic events, including one called [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]], God has created and destroyed the world many times over until the most recent one. A previous group  (now called the [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Lore In Campaigns Past/The Flashborn\|The Flashborn]]) who also came in through a portal to knock out God and stop [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]]. Regardless, now [Sol] has captured Ichico's friends through [[UMA Soul\|UMA Soul]] who is a creature called a [[UMA\|UMA]]. 
>Ichico talks about how her friends and colleagues used to be part of an organization called the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Union\|Union]] but now it is all but gone thanks to the capture of many of its members. She speaks of how the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Union\|Union]] would partake in quests to defeat UMAs and gain [[Artifacts\|Artifacts]] that will give them the power to kill [[Sol\|Sol]]. She asks the party for their aid and in return, they will be provided food and board as well a tidy sum of gold. While hesistant at first, the party eventually concedes and agrees to help. Their first target is a [[UMA\|UMA]] called "[[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]]"
