> Raised in the temple of Paeris just like [[Ilya\|Ilya]], Star grew up hearing Ilya talking about her adventures in an entirely different world called [[2-World/Earth\|Earth]]. She looks up to [[Ilya\|Ilya]] but differs from her in many ways  such as her attitudes towards social interactions and the outside world. A significant memory for her is the day she stumbled across a man playing bagpipes in front of a music store. This strange man turned out to be a Fae who took pity on her naviety and taught her how to play the most wonderous of songs. Though despite this, her goal is to go on an adventure just as grand as the one Ilya went on! 

### Experiences with romance?
> Has had a "puppy" crush before but then immediately forgot to confess to him. She then forgot about it the next and all subsequent days afterwards. 
### Idea of Justice
> She believes people can be redeemed as long as they show remorse. But if they do not? Then that is where her mercy ends.
