## The Chain of Acheron 
Ryan McTavish, the king who forged the  Chain of Acheron possessed or was speculated to possess the UnSleep negation which rendered him unable to sleep and gave him more time to devote to his craft of blacksmithing. This did not bode well for his small kingdom that was eventually reduced down to just a few hundred men during the Periamble War (a war fought against his nation and an unknown sentient white humanoid enemy called the Periamble) but did allow him enough time to create the powerful weapon that has since passed through the hands of many.  The Chain of Acheron itself is a strange weapon that has never quite been in the hands of scholars long enough to be studied. These are fragmented historical records of reported sightings (though not all may be reliable). 

"It was like he [presumed to be McTavish?] could control an entire legion of men as if they were one single unit" - Account from a refugee from the Kingdom
"When I saw Supreme Knightmaster Zodd wield it, I felt my very will to disobey him be sapped away. I felt speaking out of turn would result in my immediate banishment to the 9 hells" - account from an ex-criminal from the criminal organization "Effigies"
"I once saw a trained spy who had never been cracked before fold and betray his country within seconds of it being placed on him" - anonymous report from a man who claims to be a torturer for the Iron Shadow
"The material it is made out of is stronger than anything I have seen. I broke several of my obsidian knives just trying to get a small sliver of it to sneak away. It felt as though my forge had to burn hotter than even [[Agni\|Agni]] to melt it. When I had dilluted it with some low quality tin, the resulting blade felt as sharp as (fill in the blank I have no idea about metallurgy)" -Anonmymous report from a criminal blacksmith
