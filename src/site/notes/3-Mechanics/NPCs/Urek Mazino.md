>Urek Mazino is an eccentric character of which not much is known. Hailing from [[Sebeth\|Sebeth]], he made his name in the criminal underworld by taking on increasingly more risky/dangerous jobs with a penchant for the gigs that threw caution to the wind. He has the uncanny ability to appear and disappear out of nowhere thanks to his extensive self-taught stealth training. He participated in the raid against [[Strix 0\|Strix 0]] alongside [[Baam\|Baam]] and [[Compendium/NPC's/Sozantos\|Sozantos]] neither of which made it back without some sacrifices (such as Baam being forced to undergo polymorphization) or Sozantos having to retire from the screen. Urek Mazino however slipped out without much of a care in the world. Currently, he likes to do jobs with amateurs and experts alike as long as he feels there may be a chance for a thrill. [[Baam\|Baam]] in an argument said "It's like you only live for these cheap thrills and nothing else!".
