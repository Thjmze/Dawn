Prime Directives: 
All mid-levels and high levels have blue blood. If they are stabbed or killed, you'd notice inside their body is festering rot. All mid-levels do not have a life outside their trope. 

NPCs:
Mary Anne ran for office but lost after the narrator's grandma threw a mackerel at her.
Dick is Mary Anne's son.
She is not infected and will not be infected by UMA Decay. If you help her clean up the house, she will offer you tea. She will guide you towards the Privy Mystery. 

Privy is a middle aged woman who tells old stories, often staying by the docks but has retired to her home when the mood went down.  She is a high level agent of UMA Decay. Prepare some stories for her to tell.  [[Session Planning/Privy Stories\|Privy Stories]]

Nelkris is a nurse struggling to treat the number of people falling ill. 

Mr. Loran is a man who hasn't been seen in days. He has been stockpiling stuff for a bomb. His place smells vaguely metallic and sulfur-y. He's in charge of the initial ignition materials. His bomb tools are inside a barrel.  He owns a stable and lives in a section of it.  He's somewhat afraid but if the players have talked to atleast 3 other people OR if they have completed the festival he will be more compliant.  
He doesn't really do anything outside of his job. This is a common trait of mid-level agents. 



Zephyr was a shepherd's boy who fell through a lake last winter. His body, which was placed in the burial mountain, went missing. 

Mr. Larson was a rich man who died of frostbite, despite living in a heated house.

Nora is described as a friend of the narrator who used to make jokes and laugh.

Marrek is a drunkard who was seen sober at the docks.

Sam is the narrator's best friend, who now insists on visiting the graves daily.



Day 1:
Lyra says that before they go barging into the town, it'll help if they endear themselves to the local villagers espescially before the festival. If people recognize your face, it'll help a lot more with asking these questions. She remarks Mary Anne (the old politician) was needing some assistance now that Dick has moved out. She says "she might've been an incompotent politican, but she's one of the normal ones in this town". Lyra prepares a new herbal tea: fruit from the Razlózhnik (Raz-loyies-nick) root tea. This one tastes slightly bitter with a hint of citrus and some sweetness (though that may be from the sugar). She makes a breakfast of fried eggs with a fish paste for everyone. https://kiltedchef.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/german-recipe-1-sq.png. She suggests to help with festivites and particpate in the upcoming festival. Despite the low mood, the mayor: Damien Das is trying to host just to cheer people up.  Things to help with:

Mary Anne lifting heavy boxes needs like 2 players to do DC 12 STR Check. Chopping firewood = Needs someone with an axe to do so otherwise roll a d100 to see if weapon chips. Wood AC = 15 hp of 11.  Ignition requires fire of some kind but something pretty hot since its just wood. Ideally use firebolt or something. Mention winter has been too cold for a proper fire in a while. If they don't have Zarude, then they may be able to ignite using light cantrip or by just creativity.  Clearing snow off = either normal amounts of work OR  you can attack the snow. Will have to attack AC 13 ice to break it (black ice). As they do so, she will ocasionally bring out tea (elder-root) and snacks for them. Afterwards she invites everyone in for fish stew, 

"Thank you. It's... hard to ask for help these days. Everyone's keeping to themselves. It's a shame Privy is the only storyteller in town. I remember back when Kaelen was the one telling stories. He was so drab so its no wonder why Privy got so much more fanfare. But he never tried to suggest our burial rites were wrong!"
"We used to bury our dead under their homes so they could always be present with their families. And of course the penumbral faith followers would usually bury them towards the sky. I suppose she might be one of them. "
"But there's other mountains nearby too! I have no idea why she kept saying Skarn is the only place where people could truly be warmed."
"I'm sorry I tried to spice up the curry but the fish have tasted so bland this year. Atleast they don't have that dreadful fishy after taste but still, it feels like I'm visiting my niece in Sapone with their noodles and what not. "
"I tried to be a storyteller once but I wasn't descriptive enough. I found I could be a damn well public speaker and tried my hand at poltiics. But here, it's a lot of appeasement and negiotating through long winded letters to the North. You'd have to check over everything until it was absoulutely perfect and I just don't have that wellspring of patience"

Mention the lack of caravans lately. Suggest perhaps Dol Savik is holding back supplies for some reason. This is due to a general feeling of unease a lot of ordinary people face when nearing Durag Dral. Trade is up enough with Jadagarr recently that its no longer a top priority to get things here.  

Mentions how she's trying to work with the current mayor to organize people into doing the festival again. Mention the tradition of the arm wrestle (though it would be weird if the others tried to compete) and suggest Ellumin should show up and try to enter. If he does, it's basically can you keep someone grappled for 3 rounds whilst the rest of the party helps in some way. You'll use a monster with 15 STR for this. 

Other things to do for this,   

Indifferent about car oil = Johannes

Day 1.5:

Mary Anne is very troubled by this development. She is put at ease when she sees the pond water (it is actually 4 vials in one but seperated by dividers). She mentions she used to study the ecology of the region and brings out her microscope. Once she does so, she can ascertain that something is deeply wrong. She will become further quieted by seeing the leather bound journal and say "The highest risk ones that Privy noted down have all been killed by the Frost". It's too many concidences to add up. If they show the gunpowder + reagent she can remark "There's no way Privy herself made this. She has the privacy for storage but I don't think she has any of the equipment to create this". Once you show her Tinker tools, she can remark "This must be what she was planning. Those tools can be used to create a bomb. But for what??"

Mary Anne will also feed them information on Kaelen's old tale about the Navajo, an old folk tale about the region. 

""Blue blood..." she whispers, her voice distant. "Kaelen told a story to us once. I thought it was just a tale to scare children when I was little." She looks at you, her eyes wide with a horrifying new understanding.

"He said it happened 802 years ago, when our ancestors first settled here. A battalion of human soldiers was stationed to defend against a Dwarven horde from the mountains. But their real enemy wasn't the dwarves. Men started turning up dead, killed in their own barracks. The soldiers grew paranoid, until they noticed the small things. Some of their comrades began to walk with an **unnatural gait**. They developed a strange **repulsion to physical touch**—skin on skin—though their clothing was fine. They struggled to act naturally, as if they were forgetting how."

"They called them 'Navajo'. The old Dwarven word that meant "Decievers of flesh" And they always had one tell: **blue blood in their veins**."

"But the worst part," Mary Ann continues, her voice barely a whisper, "was that there were two kinds. The **Hogan (hoe-gone) Navajo (Nah-Vah-Hoe)** were like... like you said Privy was. They replaced someone entirely. But the **Hopi (Hopey) Navajo** were harder to spot. They would only subtly influence a person, making them do things, and then wipe the memory clean, leaving the person none the wiser. The only way to tell was by seeing their blood, or by watching them for a full day and night, questioning every single action to find the gaps in their memory. These ones could not kill or do something active like storytelling. Instead they'd just do the same things as they usually do but with side projects. A barn hand would train its horse to attack those who try to ride it or maybe a smith would purposefully engineer weak spots in his crafts."

"The story goes that the humans called for reinforcements, but... that's where the story ends. Kaelen said the written records of what happened next were destroyed or lost. It was that event that began our town's reliance on **oral tradition**; a memory can be passed down, but a book can be burned or destroyed". Its why storytellers are discouraged from writing down their stories, it meant a small part of their memory would be gone as they come to rely on the writing, and who knows what might be secretly altered when they're not looking."

If they roll a Persuasion check DC15: she will tell them this used to be a hot spot for archaeological activity. Like a lot of people would come in and examine the ruins inside Skarn. It was tolerated because no one buried their dead there until the last 20 years and the economy of Aargenbode in recent years hasn't been good enough to drive in more archaeologists. She suggests "If Privy is truly a Navajo, then finding out what she was doing with all of that gunpowder is more important than respecting the burial rites though I would suggest you ensure no one catches you sneaking in.". Those ruins are practically ancient history, perhaps if you win the Slippery Sovereigns Festival, you might be able to persuade the Mayor to give you his blessing to enter Skarn or atleast look around. Supposedly there are certain ruins that the archaelogists were unable to enter. 

The arm wrestling tournament is postponed to tomorrow. Make sure she hints that "hmm something is not right. You should really try to find out who is part of this plot and what it is they needed that many explosives for". Try looking for people you think may be able to order the ingredients for bombs and reactive agents as part of their job. I suspect Privy was just the temporary storage. And uhh make sure you cover your tracks. I believe you because I've long suspected Privy of being something other than human espescially considering the untimely nature of Kalen's killing. Actually you should look into his house aswell. There's a chance he's uncovered some details about her.  

If they look into Kaelen's house, they'll in addition find 




---- 

Kelen died unwed in his old home. His body is nowhere to be found. His home is very quaint. He will showcase a progressive mental deterioration the more time he meets with Privy. Make it so she's not a big stickler for religion (Kelen is part of the peneumbral faith). Describe her as seeming changed slightly but he can't put a finger on it. His storytelling notes are cryptic and difficult to decipher. Write in such a way that it seems he has no single train of thought. Write this irl. He initially meets with Privy because she seems extremely competent and he wants to exchange information professionally. This would be when she is 14. Make him really care about her: "I was worried I could not pass on the art of storytelling but this one she seems so promising. I suppose this was an oversight on my part but her "
Then another where you talk about her positively but in addition you make a remark about "Her storytelling is so good, she doesn't even have to rely on her appearance. She has these strange long fingers, though perhaps that's not the worst thing for a young woman to have."

"I suspect she may be being abused. I tried to dismiss it but her gait is strained. She walks with this strange hunched down posture."


"I think "she" knows that I know. I've seen the kind of books she's been reading when I was at her place. She's been looking into the orders done by most of the shops here. What the smiths orders, what the fishery buys, the alchemist's supplies and the barn hand's work. So far she hasn't made progress on any of the books. I'm not in a position to speak out against her but I swear I will bring her down"

"I think I saw her bleed blue once. I'm not sure if it's a trick of the light like with Mr. Loran or not. That fellow also seemed to have blue blood. He did have a weird complexion anyways. "

"This may very well be my last note. I've hidden this and everything else around the house. She said she wanted to "talk" and I fear my death. I really should have made more friends. Something I found out must be connected to her larger plan. "


-----

If they go out, the chance of gramps dying increases. If not then the d100 is just 99 + 1. If they do, it becomes d76 with 65 and above killing him.

Slippery Sovereigns/fun events: 

Spontaneous snowball fight: To hit AC 10 but your AC is also 10. Roll Survival or 1d3. You can have 1d2, 1d4 or 1d6 dmg as a result. Survival grants you 1d10 - 2. 
You have "20hp" each before the kids get worn out. Yes action surge and shit applies lmao. 

Arm Wrestling: Grapple contest until one person can do it for 3 rounds in a row. Allow all kinds of bullshit because fun.

Slippery Sovereigns: Roll 3d6 to try and throw the fish. 1d6 represents the fish weight, 1d6 represents slipperiness and 1d6 represents aerodynamics. You can attempt to bend the rules by changing one of these properties. In addition, those proficient can reroll up to PB.

Sparring: Fight! 

This is all shenanigans. No damaging spells or damage rolls  instead you are merely trying to spar. Something like 1d20 base and then everything else if you can give me a good enough justifcation is extra 1d20s. A 17-19 is a hit whilst a 20 is a crit. crit = bad as you actually hurt the other party. 

Have an interaction where a horse fatally kicks one player and knocks them down to half health. The horse seller is distraught and applies medicine + all that. He remarks his stable hand Rerir has been acting weird and that he'll reprimand him. The horse calms down after a while. 






Every hit gets you 1 point to a total of 5 per party. 

Darts
Roll 3d6, you are trying to get 3 of the same number. Dex mod = rerolls. 
X, X+1, X+2 = 10pts
X X X = 8pts
X X Y = 4pts
X Y Z = 0pts 

NPCs: Ryhpez

Privy tells this story over a cup of tea depending on the party's actions. 

"I knew a fisherman once. A strong man. He raged against the sea. When a storm broke his mast, he cursed the sky and built a stronger one. When a wave stole his catch, he spat in the water and cast a wider net. His hands were raw, his face was a map of worry, and his heart was a drum of constant anger. He hated the silence of the deep water.

One day, his net brought up not fish, but a smooth, grey stone, cold to the touch. As he held it, he finally heard the sea. It wasn't angry. It wasn't cruel. It was just... quiet. It told him that every wave he fought was a wasted breath. Every fish he pulled from its home was just a temporary theft from the quiet below.

He understood. He stopped mending his nets. He stopped cursing the storms. He would sit on his boat for hours, just drifting. He said the fish had lost their flavor because they, too, were tired of the fight. They were ready for the quiet. One day, he just... let his boat drift out and didn't come back. He didn't drown in a panic. He simply joined the silence. Some say struggle makes you strong. I say it just makes you tired. And sooner or later, everyone deserves to rest."

This story is the default
(Privy tells this story with her eyes half-closed, a soft, serene smile on her lips. Her voice is a low, gentle hum, like a mother soothing a child.)

The Tale of the Mountain's Cradle

Purpose: To reframe the act of burial on the mountain not as a sad duty, but as a blissful, desirable release that even the living get to experience a piece of. This story is designed to make the villagers yearn for the "peace" the mountain offers, luring them toward the entity's influence.

(Privy tells this story with her eyes half-closed, a soft, serene smile on her lips. Her voice is a low, gentle hum, like a mother soothing a child.)




"You know the cold of life, don't you? It’s not just in the wind. It's the ache in your back after hauling the nets. It's the splinter in your thumb from chopping wood. It’s the sharp word from a neighbor, the worry for tomorrow's catch, the fear of being forgotten. That coldness, we carry it within our hearts from when we are born till when we die. 

But the mountain... the mountain offers a final warmth once the body has passed. 

When it is time for someone to go home, we do not weep for their journey. We envy it. Once they are resting on the warm mountain stone, the wind that bit you at the docks here only whispers here. It stops trying to steal your heat and instead begins to carry away your burdens. With every step, a worry falls away. The argument you had last week? Gone. The weight of your years? It lifts. You feel lighter. Quieter. The soul becomes at peace with the life it had lived. 

And then you reach the cave.

The moment you step inside to deliver the body, you understand. There is no fire, but a warmth blossoms deep in your chest. It’s a peace so profound it feels like coming home after a lifetime away. It is the warmth of letting go. But the living should not stay there, it is the domain where the dead can finally be at peace. 

When we lay a body down upon the stone, it is not a burial. It is a tucking-in. We are returning a tired child to their cradle. You can see it on their faces. The lines of worry smooth out. They look more peaceful than they ever did in life. They are not dead; they are simply... finished their toil on this realm so they may pass into the next wherever that might be. Their story has been told, and they can no longer make altercations to the tapestry that is their life. They don't need to worry about silly things, they can just rest. 

And for those of us who make the journey and come back down? We carry a spark of that warmth with us. A taste of that perfect quiet. It’s a promise. A reminder that no matter how cold life gets, a gentle, welcoming peace is waiting for us all. So we must march up there to bury our dead, for if we don't, we only prolong the suffering of the deceased as their soul continues to be trapped inside their body.

Durag ‘Dral

  
 Archaeological history

The town of Durag ‘Dral was a hotspot of activity for a variety of civilizations with traces of elvish, dwarvish and even early human settlers living in the land. Specifically, it was used as a strategic outpost by the early Elvish civilization of Phlogist against the warring Dwarven civilization at the time (500 Before Ragnarok or BR) and the Dwarves mined extensive tunnels underneath the city once they had driven away the Elven forces. Furthermore, relative dating shows human activity roughly during the times of 10,000 - 982 BR but it seems rather sparse with only one significant event during 982 BR (of which little archaeological evidence remains about why there was such a mass movement of forces into the area). In reality this was due to UMA Decay decaying many corpses and only certain items outside the domain were preserved. Holy symbols and holy areas are resistant to decay. 

  

Primary Industry

Regardless, in recent years (espescially with the separation of Jadagarr in 35 BR) it has been a quiet fishing town that seems to be self-sufficient and relatively healthy. Occasionally caravans from the capital city of Dol ‘Savik will stop by to sell and buy goods from the town. Whilst all snowy regions (especially those closest to the mirrors of self) have trace elements of mana within local fauna, Durag ‘Dral’s seems to foster fish that have especially volatile magical properties. Durag ‘Dral’s rivers are fed by glacial waters from the nearby mountain of Skärn (roll your r when you say it). Regardless, as a result depending on the harvest: you may see quite interesting properties arise from the fish. This has led over the years into a very strong fishing and superstition oriented culture built around the fishing industry. Certain mutations (such as those that can imitate potions) are desired because potions are often not properly digested by the bodies of most non-adventurers due to their extreme concentration (which still remains incompatible when diluted). Many small towns in high mana density areas benefit from selling their stock to caravans in exchange for luxuries.  

  

Military Recruitment

When tensions between Jadagarr and Aargenbode was at their peak (from 25 to 0 BR), the small town was asked to contribute to the strengthening of the Aargenbodian military. What once was a relatively small peacekeeping force, now under the leadership of the new elected official Ragnar Lothbrok quickly spread propaganda to the many isolated villages that serving the newly formed Pale Star Army (the general name for the military force of Aargenbode) was an honorable thing. To accommodate the new influx, this army primarily used spears as many fishermen and hunters were intimately familiar with that as hunting weaponry. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Games/Culture

The people of Durag ‘Dral believe Skärn is a sacred site and there are many superstitions/oral histories about the mountain. For a long time, it was believed to be a bad omen if one were to bury bodies there but in recent times that has changed. Durag ‘Dral has many traditions/games but amongst the most memorable is their fish toss games or what is known as “Slippery Sovereigns”. At the time of the annual harvest (September 2nd), members of the tribe arm wrestle on the night of the frostmoon (basically the closest foggy night to Septermber 2nd) to see who can secure a spot on the 4 slots for the Slippery Sovereigns game. Those chosen will be blind folded and have to choose a random bucket from the primary catch of the harvest (you are allowed to fish for smaller fish year round but special tagged fish are restricted until aug 23). They then take off their blindfolds and throw the fish at the current elected leader of the village. If the fish are heavy (good harvest)  or the throwers are weak then the leader (who stands 60 ft away) is safe from the onslaught. During times of famine or mismanagement, the fish are small enough to be pelted straight into the faces of the leaders. To have that happen to you is a sign of great disrespect within Durag ‘Dral and most leaders often resign once this happens. However, in times of great famine (that is not the fault of the leader), many townspeople will choose to stay out of the competition until the only competitors are children or elderly whom can’t throw very far as a sign of respect towards the leader. This is considered one of the greatest honours and if the leader is still in power once the town sees a proper harvest then the biggest fishbone from said harvest is preserved in ice (now resin in the modern era) and put on display. When that leader dies, they are lowered to their grave with that very same fishbone in hand. A similar tradition (but this time for bad leaders) is done with the smallest fishbone of the famine season. 

The primary method of history retelling is through oral tradition and as such storytellers are highly valued within the community. Especially in cold winters or harsh famines, the best storytellers (before even the leaders) are offered the heated areas or good food so they may keep up the morale of the town. Often times there are less than 3 or even 2 story tellers in Durag 'Dral due to the extensive rites and practices one must do before becoming a storyteller. As a result, most storytellers come from pre-established storytelling families who often hold high status within the community. 

Religion = Church of Penumbral Faith
They believe the world is a series of tests from the supreme creator. The supreme creator, Fushi, created the world as an ark away from a virus called "Meropide". Meropide is a multi-versal virus that gradually takes over universes slowly but surely. They believe the supreme creator made thousands of species to see if any one species within the many many universes can survive the Meropide. The Supreme Creator does this because he, unlike any other being, is infected with Meropide but has managed to survive this affliction. But the Supreme Creator cannot cure it without replicating it from a living species. Such that it be, he created thousands if not millions of universes all with the intention of breeding a species that can survive the Meropide. Each universe is stored within a collection of globes that the Supreme Creator collects, observing the progress despite his ill health. Prayers often go unanswered as he has to tend to many many different universes and nurture them with his care. The followers of the Penumbral Faith believes if your willpower and desire to be answered is stronger than an entire universe, you will get your prayer.

As a result, the followers of the Penumbral Faith believe to live is to endure and overcome the most brutal of challenges. Despite the downfall of religion during [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]], the Penumbral Faith remains one of the largest religions with the smallest drop in membership through Ragnarok. 

Theological notes: the first instances of this faith occurred around 1000 BR making it one of the more "young" religions. The believers of this faith tend to believe strongly in equality and pushing forth progress. In fact, the primary strongholds of the Penumbral Faith are usually the most science focused areas. For example, Daqha, once known as the scientific capital of the world, had a staggering 60% of the country of millions subscribing to this faith. The especially devout known as Tonaries, subject themselves to extreme trials of hardship to ascend the ranks of the Church. Despite their peaceful ways, most of the exceedingly brutal (but not lethal) ways of torture were invented by Tonaries as a way to prove their fealty to God and harden their willpower. Their core belief lies on the knowledge you can only commuciate with the Supreme Creator if your willpower exceeds that of every other world in his command. The current high priest, Tonari Dalton, is said to have subjected himself to water torture for 2 weeks on end so he can build up his mental endurance. Considering the average man breaks after mere hours or at best days, some call into question the veracity of this story. Regardless, he ascended to high priesthood and is the current ruler of the church. They are primarily based in the remenants of Daqha. One major appeal for this religion is that their holy land (where the Supreme Creator supposedly created the first man) a place called Muau or True Walawo (the Dwarven word for Rebirth) was one of the only areas that resisted the firey breath during [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]]. Regardless, the Peneumbral faith remains one of the largest religions in the world and generally spreads good wherever they go. The main criticism of this faith is their staunch belief in prolonging suffering for their members (who would wait until the last few days of a treatment window to seek help) which means there are many self inflicted casualties as a result. 

The Party awakens and eats a breakfast that Lyra prepares for them as well as Razlózhnik root
tea. Ellumin tells Star and Johannes about a tradition in the town in which the townspeople
gather and throw fish at the mayor (the mayor takes it voluntarily.) In times where there is a
famine that was not caused by the mayor, only seniors, children, and disabled townsfolk will
throw fish. During this conversation, Lyra tells the party about Mary Ann, a former mayor, and
the current mayor. She tells them Mary Ann may need help with some household chores.
The party decides to visit Mary Ann first, as Ellumin knew her personally as a child. He does not
remember where Mary Ann lives, but they get there after asking some people for directions.
When they arrive, she greets them and invites them in. The party introduces themselves and
Mary Ann inquires about their travels
Mary Ann: How are your travels?
Star: It was cold. It was okay, but it was really cold.
Mary Ann: Oh, did you not take the train?
Star: No, we walked here. Well, we did a bit of it on horseback, but it was mainly walking.
Mary Ann: Oh? Why?
Star, knowing that she can’t tell Mary Ann that they’re wanted criminals and that the train would
be too risky, responds:
Star: Oh, you know. Just for fun.
Mary Ann laughs and accepts the flippant answer as simply the quirks of adventurers. She
sends Johannes and Ellumin to move some boxes into the work room while she asks Star about
her origins - where she’s from and what religion she practices. Star answers all these questions
honestly. She never mentions that her religion and hometown actually do not exist in this world,
because Mary Ann never asks.
She then asks the party for help with clearing snow outside and chopping firewood. Star uses
the Battlechelf Field knife’s fire abilities and slices up the large snow pile, melting it with ease.
Ellumin noticeably sucks at chopping wood. Johannes excels at it. It’s too cold for Ellumin to
light the furnace with his tinderbox, so he uses divine smite to light it.
Mary Ann thanks them when they’re finished, and they all sit once again to have Elderroot tea.
She talks about a half elf story teller named Privy, who has some odd opinions about burials.
Generally, the tradition in the town was to bury dead loved ones under the house, so they may
always be close. For Mary Ann, she says her religion states that people should be buried close
to the sky. However, Privy seems to be insisting that all bodies must be buried on a specific
mountain: Skarn Mountain. Skarn mountain is not particularly tall nor short. It's in the middle of
the road - of average height. However, Privy is insistent that it is “the only place where the souls
will feel warmth”. Star comments that if the mountain were the tallest in the area, then it would
make sense for Privy to think that as it would be closest to the sun. However, because it’s of
average height, she isn’t sure what to make of it. Mary Ann comments that she misses a
different story teller named Kaelen, whose stories were drab but still comforting.
Ellumin asks Mary Ann more about the story tellers in the town. We learn that Privy has been a
storyteller since Ellumin was born - roughly 20 years. Around that time, she became the town’s
only storyteller. She was a storyteller before, but 20 years ago, Kaelan died and no one has
replaced him and so she became the only one. Normally there are two to keep some
competition. Shortly afterwards she started telling of a different burial rite which made use of an
unnaturally warm cave. It’s not warm warm, but it noticeably always stays just above freezing.
And now in recent times, all the burials have since been done there. The hunch is that this is
related to the pervasive cold which has fallen over this town - that the ratio of burials being done
there has caused a shift. We are unsure whether Privy’s intention is to prevent the freeze from
worsening, or whether she is attempting to cause it. In either case, we need answers from her.
The party decides to visit Privy. Ellumin wants to keep things civil, but he is not against this
becoming an interrogation, as she clearly has information that no one else knows and that we
need.
Privy lives in a noticeably big house. Apparently, Storytellers are actually treated better than
mayors because they are the primary historians - without them, the town’s identity would
basically be gone. Thus, it’s a very well respected occupation. Privy comes from a family of
storytellers, so it makes sense she lives well. Written records aren’t commonly kept in this town.
Upon a thorough investigation, it is a normal house. A tripwire can be seen, but it’s just a typical
burglar alarm: It’s a normal house. Ellumin casts a divine sense: again he finds nothing. Ellumin
prepares his spear and steps over the tripwire so he doesn’t set it off.
They knock on the door and it swings open on its own. Being cautious, Star knocks on the
doorframe and calls out: “Hello, miss? May we come in?”
Her voice echoes throughout the house, echoing back before Privy appears. She recognizes
Ellumin and greets them. She apologizes, stating she isn’t hosting any storytelling nights
tonight.
“That’s alright,” Ellumin says, “but if you have the time, we were interested in one particular
story.
She invites them inside and they sit at the dining table. She is visibly walking strangely - in a
way that is not caused by injury. Privy apologizes that she doesn’t have any food prepared and
excuses herself to cook them something. Before leaving, she invites them to explore the dining
room and living room. However, she asks them not to go upstairs: “private business, I’m sure
you understand.”
With 45 minutes to themselves, Ellumin examines the dining room and the living room.
Curiously, in the dining room, there is a piano in the corner. It’s visibly not used often, collecting
dust, however it’s odd that it’s in the dining room and not the living room. There are two sets of
drawers as well. However Star hesitates to rummage through them, as she feels it’d be bad
manners.
For the living room, it looks as if she hasn’t had many people over - like a showroom. Like it’s
more for decoration rather than living in. It’s used more as a business room - the room where
she holds her storytelling nights. It has a desk, bookshelves, couches and an armchair and a
fireplace, and most notably, a giant globe by the back wall. One bookshelf has a lot of instruction
manuals such as books about social etiquette, and parenting books. The other bookshelf
contains more non-fiction, but it’s increasingly strange. One in particular is specifically a manual
on how to operate a specific type of machinery that notably would not be stored or utilized in a
home nor would it be used in her line of work as a storyteller. There are also: acting guides
about micro expressions, guides on how to talk to people, many books about general anatomy,
as well as Census books - books of all the people in Durag Dral.
Ellumin, noting the many books about social etiquette and anatomy. She appears to be putting
much effort into studying human behaviour and etiquette. One can be socially awkward, but this
is a lot. This combined with her strange gait makes him think that Privy is not who she says she
is, or perhaps is no longer who she is - that she’s been replaced. The plan is to ask about the
Skarn mountain story about the burial grounds and to keep an eye on her. If everything checks
out, we stay civil. If there are red flags, we interrogate, and if it escalates, Ellumin will cast Zone
of Truth.
In the desk, Ellumin finds a book with various stories written down. It’s not common for stories to
be written down here, but there are a few in this book. The pages have some green spill stains,
similar to the color of oxidised copper. Ellumin recognizes the stories in the books are transcripts
of Kaelan’s old stories.
Note: Kaelan is more of a self starting Storyteller rather than one from a family of storytellers like
Privy, so his house would not be as nice as Privy’s.
The party refrains from entering the second floor as they were specifically forbidden there, and
refrain from entering the bedroom as Privy only gave them permission to access the living room,
dining room, and bathroom. Thus, the search ends.
Privy returns with fish-based dishes and they begin to talk. The party requests the Skarn
Mountain story. When she comments that Ellumin would have heard the story dozens of times
growing up, Star jumps in and says she wanted to hear it and Ellumin explains he can’t
remember enough details to tell it to her properly.
When Privy tells the story, she is very calm, her tone is akin to a soft mother soothing a child.
Privy has always changed her tone of voice based on the type of story - a strength she had over
Kaelan, who always told every story in the same voice.
Generally, the story is as follows:
“You know the cold of life, don't you? It’s not just in the wind. It's the ache in your back after
hauling the nets. It's the splinter in your thumb from chopping wood. It’s the sharp word from a
neighbor, the worry for tomorrow's catch, the fear of being forgotten. That coldness, we carry it
within our hearts from when we are born till when we die.
But the mountain... The mountain offers a final warmth once the body has passed.
When it is time for someone to go home, we do not weep for their journey. We envy it. Once
they are resting on the warm mountain stone, the wind that bit you at the docks here only
whispers here. It stops trying to steal your heat and instead begins to carry away your burdens.
With every step, a worry falls away. The argument you had last week? Gone. The weight of your
years? It lifts. You feel lighter. Quieter. The soul becomes at peace with the life it had lived.
And then you reach the cave.
The moment you step inside to deliver the body, you understand. There is no fire, but a warmth
blossoms deep in your chest. It’s a peace so profound it feels like coming home after a lifetime
away. It is the warmth of letting go. But the living should not stay there, it is the domain where
the dead can finally be at peace.
When we lay a body down upon the stone, it is not a burial. It is a tucking-in. We are returning a
tired child to their cradle. You can see it on their faces. The lines of worry smooth out. They look
more peaceful than they ever did in life. They are not dead; they are simply... finished their toil
on this realm so they may pass into the next wherever that might be. Their story has been told,
and they can no longer make altercations to the tapestry that is their life. They don't need to
worry about silly things, they can just rest. And for those of us who make the journey and come
back down? We carry a spark of that warmth with us. A taste of that perfect quiet. It’s a promise.
A reminder that no matter how cold life gets, a gentle, welcoming peace is waiting for us all. So
we must march up there to bury our dead, for if we don't, we only prolong the suffering of the
deceased as their soul continues to be trapped inside their body.”
The story is weird. So weird and creepy in fact, that Ellumin and Johannes are tempted to jump
to casting Zone of Truth as soon as it’s done. Johannes feels that it’s almost hypnotic. Ellumin’s
Divine Sense and Detect Magic still have not detected anything.
Ellumin Casts Zone of truth. Privy fails the Spell save dc.
Ellumin asks, “Are you who you say you are?”
She begins to get up to try to leave the circle, and he signals Johannes to point his gun at her,
freezing her in her tracks.
Privy: “you come into this house, the house of a story teller, beg me for a story, and dare-”
Ellumin: “answer the question.”
Privy: “Is my body not of a storyteller?”
Star: “Is your mind of a storyteller?”
Privy continues to avoid answering the question directly.
Ellumin: “are you, Mind, body, and soul, Privy?”
Privy does not answer.
Johannes and Ellumin are standing at the entrances to the dining room and roll intimidation. It
works, because the sight of two very tall built men standing at the only exits of the room, one
armed with guns, is very scary.
“...Fine. what do you want to know?”
“Who are you?”
“Have I not been clear in my answer?”
Finding that the “who are you” line of questioning is not working, Ellumin asks, “what has
befallen this town?”
Jyo: “Everyone roll initiative.”
Everyone: “Fuq, WHAT?”
Privy runs to the corner where the piano is, jamming herself against the wall so she’s just barely
out of the zone of truth, and reaches behind the piano.
Jal: “JOHANNES ROLEPLAY THE AMERICAN POLICE FORCE”
Kara: “SHOOT HER JOHANNES SHOOT HER-”
Johannes shoots both of her legs. Both her kneecaps explode. Her blood is a teal blue. Similar
to the green stains in the book. Johannes uses an action surge and walks over to her, grabs her,
and tosses her back into the zone of truth, in the center, on the dining table. She grabs a knife
she set out for cutlery, jamming it into her throat and up to her skull, killing herself and ending
the fight.
Star loots her body and finds that she’s not carrying anything one would typically carry in
everyday life, such as keys or the like. Upon closer inspection, she isn’t even wearing
undergarments - she’s wearing clothes, but that’s it. As if to mimic human behaviour. Ellumin
and Johannes investigated the piano to see what she was reaching for. They find a button on
the wall. Ellumin presses it.
There is a loud alarm that rings through the entire house, and they hear a smoke signal being lit.
The entire town would know that something is up with the storyteller. It makes sense the
storyteller would have these alarms in place, as there are people who would want to silence her.
Now that Privy is dead, The party splits up to investigate the rest of the house. Johannes enters
the bedroom and finds a plant with mold in it, a potion vial with water in it, tinkerer’s tools
scattered about the desk, and a single leather bound journal. Skimming through it, he finds it’s a
census, different observations of people - such as how often people usually get sick, how many
family members they have, and how much people would miss them. In the chest by the bed,
there’s multiples of the outfit she was wearing - Green shawls, traditional storytelling uniforms.
Nothing else. She only has the one outfit, everyday. Hidden deep in a corner, he finds another
journal, and this one is filled with nearly illegible writing. It’s the handwriting of a child - written by
the real Privy when she was thirteen, talking of how boring Kaelan’s stories are, and that she
could find better stories if she went out to explore. She talks about how her parents refuse to let
her explore the mountain. She talks of how she admires Kaelan for being well liked, and how
she wants to explore the world and make her own stories. Because she has a talent for telling
stories, but she’d rather tell stories she’s experienced herself, instead of the same stories all the
time. The final entry details a day where her parents aren’t home.
“Today is the day I’m going to do it. I’m going to sneak out, and find a story worth telling.”
Ellumin explores upstairs and finds that it’s mainly underdeveloped. He looks at the walls and
compares the interior to the outside. The walls are noticeably smaller than they were on the
outside. He finds nothing suspicious: storytelling notes, and presents she may have received.
He takes a dagger and tries to cut open a wall. He runs the blade across, cutting through it.
There’s a strange, grey and smoky smelling powder on the tip of his knife.
Johannes and Ellumin dig their blade into the wall and manage to wedge it open. They find
barrels upon barrels and vials upon vials. The grey powder comes from a barrel that ellumin
stabbed when he stabbed his blade through. The vials are filled with an unknown liquid. Star
offers to fill her waterskin with the powder so they can investigate it when they leave. Johannes
and Ellumin take two vials each.
The powder in the second floor is most likely gunpowder Ellumin and Johannes decide to blow
up the house, so that when the townspeople saw the Smoke alarm, they’d think “oh, she called
for help because her house caught fire,” and not “Oh, she called for help because people are in
her house.”
Ellumin and Johannes drag Privy’s body to the kitchen, and turn on all the gas burners. Ellumin
wraps his returning spear with cloth, lights it, and walks down the hallway. He launches his
spear back at the stove. As soon as the fire begins to spread, he returns his spear back to him,
and books it out of the house.
The house shakes and explosions ring out as they rush out of the house. The fire spreads
quickly, and Johannes gets burned a bit. Star and Ellumin make it out unscathed. The
townspeople can be heard in the distance. They entered and left Privy’s house through the back
door so the townspeople haven’t seen them yet. Star casts invisibility on everyone and they
sneak away. Johannes and Ellumin are good at covering their tracks as they go, Star not so
much. They return to Mary Ann’s House.
