## Introduction
After a catastrophic dam break flooded their cave, the Sub One Club resurfaced amid a fierce snowstorm. Seeking shelter, they made camp near ancient ruins. During watch shifts, Vivi noticed an eerie phenomenon in the northern lights—snake-like coils weaving through the Aurora Borealis.

Earlier, the party hunted and butchered a limping frost salamander, harvesting nearly 248 lbs of meat and about 11 lbs of skin. Though the haul was excessive for their quest, they sold the surplus in town, each earning roughly 53 gp and 8 silver. Back at the Adventurer’s Guild, Allayna questioned their choice to butcher so much, seeing it as overkill for a simple meat procurement tied to a man’s humble date plans.

Splitting into pairs to sell their goods, the group regrouped to meet Juven Hien, who challenged their bold plan to rob the Sinners—a ruthless criminal syndicate notorious for crushing challengers. The heist was orchestrated at the behest of Ichico Nemuri, who cannot act openly due to her ties with the Sinners but wants the Chain of Acheron stolen from them via the Sub One Club.

Juven shared how Sozantos once saved him from a sting by the memory-erasing Knights Moralis and begrudgingly offered the party a 15% cut of the heist’s take. He described “The Big One,” the Sinners’ vault rumored to hold a staggering 200 million gp—enough to sway or topple a small nation. He also revealed that Baam, a tall sneaky half-orc long missing, was caught during a failed sting and his fate remains unknown.

The party finalized their approach: infiltrate through a cave, submerge underwater to evade detection, and breach the vault’s main entrance via the underground sewage system. Juven warned of the vault’s arcane defenses—a complex maze requiring one blind navigator guided by teammates, disappearing walls, ghosts, and strange magical traps.

Next steps include locating Baam, recruiting wild card Urek Mazino, and sharpening their heist strategy using radar systems, teleportation portals, and alarm sabotage to maximize their chances.


> As you finish planning your grand heist, you feel Juven Hein look at you folks and say "Listen I'm feeling generous so I'll volunteer this information for free, especially consider you all seem to be naturals at this line of work. If you want any hope at finding this man, I would strongly suggest investigating the nearby black market and the surrounding slums. Those people know a lot more than they'll let on and if you can pay up or earn their trust, you'll likely be a lot closer to finding [[Baam\|Baam]]"
