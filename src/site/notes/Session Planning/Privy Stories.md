Privy tells this story over a cup of tea depending on the party's actions. 

"I knew a fisherman once. A strong man. He raged against the sea. When a storm broke his mast, he cursed the sky and built a stronger one. When a wave stole his catch, he spat in the water and cast a wider net. His hands were raw, his face was a map of worry, and his heart was a drum of constant anger. He hated the silence of the deep water.

One day, his net brought up not fish, but a smooth, grey stone, cold to the touch. As he held it, he finally heard the sea. It wasn't angry. It wasn't cruel. It was just... quiet. It told him that every wave he fought was a wasted breath. Every fish he pulled from its home was just a temporary theft from the quiet below.

He understood. He stopped mending his nets. He stopped cursing the storms. He would sit on his boat for hours, just drifting. He said the fish had lost their flavor because they, too, were tired of the fight. They were ready for the quiet. One day, he just... let his boat drift out and didn't come back. He didn't drown in a panic. He simply joined the silence. Some say struggle makes you strong. I say it just makes you tired. And sooner or later, everyone deserves to rest."

The Tale of the Mountain's Cradle

Purpose: To reframe the act of burial on the mountain not as a sad duty, but as a blissful, desirable release that even the living get to experience a piece of. This story is designed to make the villagers yearn for the "peace" the mountain offers, luring them toward the entity's influence.

"You know the cold of life, don't you? It’s not just in the wind. It's the ache in your back after hauling the nets. It's the splinter in your thumb from chopping wood. It’s the sharp word from a neighbor, the worry for tomorrow's catch, the fear of being forgotten. That coldness, we carry it within our hearts from when we are born till when we die. 

But the mountain... the mountain offers a final warmth once the body has passed. 

When it is time for someone to go home, we do not weep for their journey. We envy it. Once they are resting on the warm mountain stone, the wind that bit you at the docks here only whispers here. It stops trying to steal your heat and instead begins to carry away your burdens. With every step, a worry falls away. The argument you had last week? Gone. The weight of your years? It lifts. You feel lighter. Quieter. The soul becomes at peace with the life it had lived. 

And then you reach the cave.

The moment you step inside to deliver the body, you understand. There is no fire, but a warmth blossoms deep in your chest. It’s a peace so profound it feels like coming home after a lifetime away. It is the warmth of letting go. But the living should not stay there, it is the domain where the dead can finally be at peace. 

When we lay a body down upon the stone, it is not a burial. It is a tucking-in. We are returning a tired child to their cradle. You can see it on their faces. The lines of worry smooth out. They look more peaceful than they ever did in life. They are not dead; they are simply... finished their toil on this realm so they may pass into the next wherever that might be. Their story has been told, and they can no longer make altercations to the tapestry that is their life. They don't need to worry about silly things, they can just rest. 

And for those of us who make the journey and come back down? We carry a spark of that warmth with us. A taste of that perfect quiet. It’s a promise. A reminder that no matter how cold life gets, a gentle, welcoming peace is waiting for us all. So we must march up there to bury our dead, for if we don't, we only prolong the suffering of the deceased as their soul continues to be trapped inside their body.
