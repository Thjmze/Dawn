## Shocking terrorist attack upon the Frostlance foiled by impromptu vigiliantes?

## Shocking Attack on the Frostlance Foiled by Unlicensed Intervention?

**Kleistwood, Svalch ** â€“ On July 31st, a routine journey aboard the **Frostlance**, an express train en route from Jadagarr to Svalich, was disrupted by a harrowing incident near the Aargen Dam. While a terrorist attack was reportedly thwarted, the actions of an unvetted group of individuals claiming to be adventurers have raised serious questions regarding the outcome and the safety of the passengers.

Initial reports indicate that a **Magical Obstructive Device (MOD)** was planted in the train's engine, designed to cut off its vital coal supply and leave it stranded in the frigid Aargenbodian desert. Simultaneously, assailants moved towards the rear of the train, that left two crew members dead and one in critical condition. 

John Locke, a retired train mechanic, recounted the unsettling beginning of the ordeal: "It was around 3:15 PM when I noticed the train vibrated in a different way than usual. Within minutes, I saw strange people, dressed more like steerage folks than regular passengers, running through the train, shoving many passengers out of the way! I remember one was a **Tiefling** girl, and the other looked to be an older **Warforged** used in the war."

These individuals, later identified as the "**Sub One Club**," proceeded to the engine car, apparently taking it upon themselves to address the crisis. Ellis Mualani, the chief engineer onboard, stated, "I didn't even question why they were there! I figured they might be able to help, and one of them managed to blast the MOD with a powerful bolt of lightning. Unfortunately, that decimated the coal-starter and created a hairline fracture within the drive shaft." Mualani further explained that this critical damage rendered the engine unable to accelerate from a standstill, only capable of maintaining its current cruising speed of 103 km/h. This unapproved intervention forced the train into a precarious state, relying on a hybrid system to convert snow into mana to maintain velocity.

While the "Sub One Club" then pursued the terrorists, who had reportedly disembarked from the train, the consequences of their initial actions remain stark. Witnesses in the dining car reported hearing a loud scuffle, dismissing it as part of the upcoming dinner rush. It was only after several tense minutes that a man, his face obscured, burst into the dining car and, upon being cornered by train guards and the "adventurers," dramatically leapt from a window.

Following the confrontation, Ms. Mualani confirmed that the "[[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Sub One Club\|Sub One Club]]" assisted her in coordinating rescue efforts with Central Railway Command. However, the command's response highlighted the severity of the engine damage: no repair train would be dispatched due to prohibitive costs. Instead, the Frostlance was instructed to proceed directly to Kleistwood, 1804 kilometres away, maintaining its critical speed of 103km/hr. This dire situation necessitated the immediate cessation of non-essential luxuries, including hot meals, cabin stabilizers, and bath boilers, leading to considerable passenger discomfort and potential unrest.

Upon arrival in Kleistwood, reporters from the _Kleistwood Times_ attempted to question the "Sub One Club" about their involvement. Their responses were notably sparse and evasive. When pressed on how they "defused" the situation, the **Warforged** member, identifying himself only as "Johannes," tersely replied, "By shooting." None of the other members offered their names, nor would they elaborate on their presence on the train or the full extent of their actions.

Correspondence with the Vanyra Adventurer's Guild reveals that this party only registered with the organization on July 28th, just days before the incident, and had not yet received their permanent adventuring bands. Their swift departure from the scene, coupled with their refusal to answer further questions, leaves a cloud of suspicion.

The incident raises troubling questions: Was this a spontaneous act of heroism, or a calculated maneuver by an aspiring group of adventurers seeking notoriety? And at what cost to passenger safety and the train's operational integrity? The deaths of Tomie Toplis and Sarah Goldwing, whose lives might have been saved had the "Sub One Club" focused solely on the immediate threat and left the engine to qualified technicians, cast a grim shadow over their self-proclaimed heroics. The investigation by the Kleistwood Times will continue to seek answers to these pressing concerns.
