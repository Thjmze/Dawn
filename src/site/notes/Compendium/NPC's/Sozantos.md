>He hates to admit it but he was born into poverty in the reef/underdark region of [[Impasi\|Impasi]]. When he finally tracked down his birth mother, he only managed to talk her into raising him as a false child. Treated as nothing more than a servant boy and paid a pittance, he would turn to crime in the streets to bring home enough money to feed himself. He held the belief that if he was able to live an equally lavish life style as his parents, then they would finally accept him. So when his mother's estate burnt down and his greedy uncle wouldn't dare pitch in...he chose to instead give her money out of his sizeable savings as long as she never asked any questions where it came from. They lived a middle-class life until one day he came home smelling awful but he said they would never worry about money again.  Nearby news spread of a local Baron "The Baron of [[Drauma Lumurbo\|Drauma Lumurbo]]" who had recently died in an unprovoked act of arson. He wasn't particularly well-liked so no one really questioned his death and his only notable  relative (his sister) refused to hire anyone to investigate, it was ruled as likely being from some kind of eccentric activity. Never again was it mentioned. 

>An expert thief with many connections from his old days of robbing from the rich and going on quite a few scores, he has built up a sizeable network of trustworthy associates. When it comes to planning a heist, there are none better than [[Ida Kitagawa\|Ida Kitagawa]] or [[Juven Hien\|Juven Hien]]. He worked with [[Ida Kitagawa\|Ida Kitagawa]] to rob a mine almost seconds after it excavated one of the biggest gold chunks they have ever seen. [[Juven Hien\|Juven Hien]] and him go back even further as a duo that would rob many targets blind. He and Juven Hien used to be part of a crew: The [[WallBreakers\|WallBreakers]] which ended in tragedy as most of them were caught by a group known as the [[Sinners\|Sinners]] after a heist gone wrong. [[Juven Hien\|Juven Hien]] and [[Compendium/NPC's/Sozantos\|Sozantos]] were able to escape using false bodies as decoys. 80 years since his birth, with the sole exception of [[Juven Hien\|Juven Hien]], none remember his old appearance nor name. He posits the story he grew up in nobility and killed his mother to steal her wealth though a thorough investigation will show the timeline doesn't quite add up. But none have really tried to investigate him. He knows [[Baam\|Baam]] as a friend who saved his ass while he was pinned down by the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Knights Moralis\|Knights Moralis]] in a dire situation. Him, Juven Hien, Baam and [[Compendium/NPC's/Urek Mazino\|Urek Mazino]] are the only known individuals in history to get into [[Strix 0\|Strix 0]]

##### Urek Mazino
> The only man who terrifies Sozantos is [[Compendium/NPC's/Urek Mazino\|Urek Mazino]]. A lunatic that can only be considered a force of nature, not even Sozantos has a particularly strong influence on him though they have worked together a few times. This man only lives for battle and cannot be considered as a loyal ally. You better hope you don't bore him and you'll be fine. 

### Examples of Speech
> Now, this may be a little… unconventional, but considering the sheer amount of heat you’ll be taking on with this gig, you’re not going to find a ton of criminals willing to host you. Let alone [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico]]. [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/The Sinners\|The Sinners]] have eyes everywhere, darling. Everywhere. So, here’s a thought: sign up with an adventurer’s guild nearby.
> When it comes to a job like this, there ain’t a single thing like being overprepared. Get some gold—trust me, the guilds are always in need of members these days. Save up enough for some good equipment, preferably something made in the city. And give yourselves an alibi. Adventurers going on a hunt the day of? Perfect. No one will bat an eye.
> Not even I want to deal with the heat that taking on the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/The Sinners\|Sinners]] will bring. So, if you’re smart—and I’m beginning to doubt that—you’ll follow my advice. Blend in, build your cover, and for the sake of everything, don’t get caught.”
>Ah, my dear fledgling felons, if you’re truly serious about orchestrating a heist worthy ofs legend against an organization as formidable as the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/The Sinners\|Sinners]], then listen closely—though, let’s be honest, if you’re relying on me to spoon-feed you every detail, you might as well hand over your cut now and save yourself the embarrassment. I’m not here to play mommy to a gaggle of amateur thieves, teaching you how to pilfer from your miserly uncle who couldn’t spare a copper after your dear aunt’s estate went up in flames. No, no, darling. If you want to succeed, you’ll need _intel_. And lucky for you, I happen to have a few... _connections_ from my more _colorful_ days who might be persuaded to lend a hand.
> First, let’s talk about [[Ida Kitagawa\|Ida Kitagawa]]. She’s as grounded as they come, and so is her information—straight from the gutters, the alleys, and the mouths of local lowlifes. Her sources are the kind of people who’ve seen the Sinners’ warehouse from the outside, maybe overheard a guard’s schedule, or caught wind of a rumor about traps. It’s not polished, but it’s reliable in its own rough way. If you need to know where to find certain equipment or who to ask, she’ll point you in the right direction—though expect her recommendations to be cut from the same cloth as her. Now, Ida’s soft-hearted, bless her, and if you manage to impress her (which, frankly, shouldn’t be too hard if you’ve got half a brain), she might even knock her usual fee down from 15% to 10% of your final haul. A bargain, really, for someone who’s practically a saint in this line of work. Though test her too much and she'll demand a flat rate.
> But if you’re feeling fancy—or perhaps just masochistic—there’s always [[Juven Hien\|Juven Hien]]. Oh, Jueven. He’s cut from the same cloth as yours truly, darling, and when it comes to heists, he’s a perfectionist. Guard schedules? Weaknesses? Tells and ticks? He’s got it all mapped out like a symphony of chaos. His sources are... well, let’s just say they’re as highbrow as he is, and just as insufferable. The man would research the specific coffee bean the guards prefer just to poison the next shipment and ensure they’re all in a state of mild delirium during your heist. He’s meticulous, conscientious, and utterly brilliant—but don’t let that fool you. His temperament is as foul as his methods are flawless. If he senses even a hint of weakness in you, he’ll hike his price up faster than you can say “20% of the cut.” So, darling, if you choose to work with him, be on your best behavior. He’s a master at sniffing out incompetence, and he’ll make you pay for it—literally.
> There you have it, my dear would-be thieves. Two options, each with their own charms and challenges. Choose wisely, and try not to embarrass yourselves too much. After all, the Sinners won’t be kind to fools.
> "Oh, my dearest doomed delinquents, let’s not delude ourselves—the Sinners don’t _misplace_ their treasures. They inventory them bi-weekly with the kind of obsessive precision usually reserved for tax collectors and serial killers. So even if you pull off the heist flawlessly (a laughable notion, but indulge me), they’ll notice. And when they do? They won’t send a politely worded letter. They’ll send _nightmares_ wearing human skin to hunt you through every plane of existence. Remember the [[WallFacers\|WallFacers]]? No? Exactly. Because the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/The Sinners\|Sinners]] made sure nobody would."
>"But you? You’ll have _me_ whispering in your ear. So here’s your first lesson in survival: _Lie better than you steal._ March your sorry selves down to the adventurers’ guild today—not tomorrow, not ‘when you feel ready,’ _today_—and sign up. Then, when the vault’s contents vanish, you’ll be conveniently ‘lost’ in some dungeon, covered in monster guts and plausible deniability. Bonus: you might actually learn which end of a sword to hold. And for the love of all things wicked, _start building your legend now._ My associates adore competent fools almost as much as they despise incompetent ones. The difference is measured in gold. And blood."
> "Tick-tock, darlings. The Sinners’ patience isn’t the only thing running out."
> Ah, my darling dilettantes, let’s be _frank_—none of you are what one might call _actual_ criminals. Oh, you’ve got the spirit, I’ll give you that, but spirit alone won’t keep you alive when the Sinners come knocking. No, no, what you need is someone with _real_ on-field experience. Someone who’s danced with danger more times than you’ve tied your boots. And there’s no one quite like _[[Compendium/NPC's/Urek Mazino\|Urek Mazino]]_ for that.
> [[Compendium/NPC's/Urek Mazino\|Urek Mazino]] is the kind of man who makes even _me_ raise an eyebrow. The type of individual everyone is quietly relieved has chosen our side over the pigs. He’s a force of nature, darling, and if you can convince him to join your little escapade, consider half your problems solved. Now, I can’t tell you what he’ll charge—that’s entirely up to how well you can sell this heist to him. But let’s be honest, the mere idea of breaking into the vault of the _[[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/The Sinners\|Sinners]]_? Oh, he’ll be intrigued. The man lives for chaos, and this? This is chaos wrapped in a bow.

> These days, [[Compendium/NPC's/Urek Mazino\|Urek]] rarely meets in person, so you’ll likely have to deal with one of his associates. But don’t let that deter you. Getting a man like him on your side is practically _mandatory_ for a job of this scale. He can dismantle security measures, hide bodies (yours or the guards’, depending on how well you perform), and provide the kind of support that only a seasoned professional can offer. But—and this is a _big_ but, darling—be warned: [[Compendium/NPC's/Urek Mazino\|Urek]] isn’t in it for the money or loyalty. He’s in it for the thrill. If you make too many foolish mistakes, alert the guards, or generally bungle things up, he won’t hesitate to leave you to your fate. He’s unstable, unpredictable, and utterly indispensable. There’s no one else in the business who can match him, but that also means there’s no one else who’ll cut you loose faster if you prove incompetent.
> So, my dear would-be thieves, if you want [[Compendium/NPC's/Urek Mazino\|Urek Mazino]] on your side, you’d better bring your A-game. Sell him on the heist, keep your wits about you, and for the love of all that’s unholy, _don’t screw up_. Because if you do, well... let’s just say the Sinners won’t be the only ones you’ll need to worry about.
