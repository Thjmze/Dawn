### Appearance
> JOHANNES in his human form has a head full of dark, neatly combed hair streaked with a single line of gray that frames his sharp, angular face, lending him an air of calculated authority. A thick, well-groomed black beard rests on his jawline and his face is decorated with piercing cold eyes. In his daily attire he dons a  pristine white coat, marked by bold crimson accents and secured with metallic clasps that carry both the significance of rank and practicality. Beneath it, a navy-blue shirt and perfectly knotted red tie. A black strap cut diagonally across his chest.
> JOHANNES in his warforged form, becomes something else entirely. His hair transforms into a smooth, angular headplate, while his beard becomes intricately etched steel, mimicking the human shape it replaced. His head is adorned with robotic  glowing eyes, that radiate intensity. The coat turns into segmented metal plates, with crimson veins of energy pulsing faintly. A luminous core burns steadily at the center of his chest. 

### Current story
> Forged to be an elite soldier since his creation, his soul was constructed by merging together the fragmented inferior souls of volunteers and animals alike. Due to this, he possesses a highly unstable soul that may fracture more easily than others. Brought into an artificial body, he was developed to be a commander unit that would lead and inspire many troops on the brutal battlefields of the Nexus. Enrolled within various armed forces and militas, he was a surprisingly capable commander that fought valiantly in many conflicts and quickly ascended the ranks. However, despite this after his failure to win the infamous battle of the somme, he was forcibly retired and replaced with a new model. Though he may be retired, he is still full of fighting spirit  and thus has chosen to become an adventurer so he may relive his glory days.   He has brought upon the gaze and blessing therein of UMA Death so that he may serve as an instrument to allow her to gain power.
