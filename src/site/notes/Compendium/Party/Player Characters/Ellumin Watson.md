> Ellumen is a [[Compendium/Lore/Races/Elves\|Half Elf]] born and raised in [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Aargenbode/Aargenbode\|Aargenbode]]. He was raised by a single [[Compendium/Lore/Races/Humans\|Human]] father, as his [[Compendium/Lore/Races/Elves\|Elven]] mother had passed in childbirth. His father was a former soldier in the national army, and when he was of age Ellumen took up the legacy and joined the army. Soon after, he lost track of his father, as his father was called back into the war effort. A promising young soldier Ellumen was placed into the vanguard or special operations unit of the core. Over many fighting years he managed to land in good standing with the corps though he was never particularly happy with his actions. Often he found  disdain for the work he conducted as part of what amounted to a mail order kill team. While he may have held disdain for his line of duty, he still outputted good effort so he may serve his king and country. 
#### Prior to adventure
> During [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]], armies stood still. Wars seemed petty in the face of total and utter annihilation. So he and his team of three others glorified mercenaries watched from their barracks. After the aversion of disaster, in what many saw as a time of rejoicing and praise, his superiors decided they saw an opportunity to shift the odds in their favour. In the midst of an apocalypse, they saw a chance to take Jadagarr. Assuming that they would be in a state of joy and unprepared for an attack, his team was ordered to strike a key watch post for the Jadagarr military, a couple kilometers from the border of the city. It was normally heavily fortified, but it was believed that they could take out the assumed skeleton crew, or lay claim to an empty outpost. Ellumen drew the line here though, as [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]] had fully broken his already tenuous supports for his own work, and he couldn't stand to kill more people over petty land squabbles, who just wanted a life of their own, outside of a hungry empire, when threats of such an insane magnitude existed. He refused orders, and was promptly dishonourably discharged. He still carries his old spear, shield and breastplate, which either were bound to him magically, too cheap to bother about, or tailored to him specifically. 
> He began to wander, leaving Aargenbode, and traveling south, away from his troubled past. On his travels is where he swore his oath, in the language of the fae (The fey are beings of rules and promises, and the language is even deeper tied to oaths then even them. An oath in this language, with proper wording, is where much of the power comes from):

A gealltanas chun coinnigh (“A Promise To Keep” In deep sylvian) (***)
For as long as I breath
For as long as the sky burns
I will not stand by
I will not watch as others are trampled by gods or demons
I will not let those beyond this realm shape the fate of humanity (*)
I will not yield
A gealltanas chun buail
