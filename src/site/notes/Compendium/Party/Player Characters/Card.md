> Born and raised in a little peaceful and quiet Tiefling village with her family, "Card" was orginally named Achillea. The villagers were friendly and lived a hassle-free life. Yet, despite their behaviour, some individuals believe Tieflings are incapable of redemption and must be cleansed at all costs. One of these extremist groups stormed into her village with their Paladins and took the children (including a ten year old Achillea) that resided within into a work camp. These brutal camps put young tiefling children to work as janitors, child soldiers  and any other dirty work that the higher ups would rather not get involved in. Thanks to an ancient animal spirit that dwelled within her,  Achillea peformed her tasks with striking efficiency resulting in her derogatory nickname "Wild Card" or "Card" for short mainly because her superiors likened her to a wild animal that should be put down. 
>When "Card" was 14, she alongside some other "worthless tiefling" children were sent in as fodder to kill a beast that was threatening the local village. The beast ended up being too much for these children to handle and it killed not only the investigating party but also the village they were tasked with protecting leaving only "Card"  left alive before it promptly escaped to locations unknown. When she reports the incident to her higher ups, they do not really care and it was deemed an acceptable loss as long as they sufficiently covered it up. When they failed to do so and the camp was going to become the subject of a thorough investigation by the authorities, a plan was enacted by the higher-ups to murder the tiefling children and move base to a more discrete location. A sympathehtic tiefling paladin within the group informs Card of this plan and she alongside some other friends formulated an escape plan. Luck however was not on her side when another Paladin had overheard his Tiefling colleague's message and intercepted this group that was trying to escape. Likely for her, after witnessing the murder of her friends, the ancestral beast within finally emerged and she escaped to a far-away city.
>Life still didn't get better as she found herself unable to secure employment and now haunted by her friends who would still call her by her childhood nickname of "Achi" who whisper tales of returning to "where the Yarrow grows". A human soldier finally helps her secure employment and housing by convincing his superior officer to enlist her into the army. 

### Justice
The corrupt who abuse their power must fall if we are to live in a better world. Specifically she wants proper burials for her Tiefling brethren, and for the death of the Paladins that did all this to her Tiefling village. 
### Romance
Believes herself bisexual as she had not found any attraction towards either sex. Most likely asexual or aromantic.
