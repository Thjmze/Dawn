> Minthe is a gnome Battlesmith with Digigrade legs, long ears, and a tail for balance. She belongs to the Nexian Gnome species which are highly carnivorous nomadic creatures though not entirely incapable of digesting plant matter however it is noted to be uncommon amongst wild gnomes in comparison to city or "civilized" gnomes. Gnomes also believe in a nomadic lifestyle as a way to preserve prey populations so they routinely head towards warmer places when they believe winter is on the horizon. Gnomes are naturally excellent hunters, leather workers and overall tradesmen. Regardless of these differences, she is from a nomadic gnome group that eventually settled into a small village. She is the runt of her siblings and as a result, was far shorter  (2'9) than even her siblings. During her adolescent years, she took on Gnomish Smithing and then turned to artificing but she is primarily a tinkerer at heart. It appears she may have some interest in artificial creation of life as evidenced by her invention of "[[Voyager\|Voyager]]", her steel defender. Using some clever work and smithing, she has been able to implant a broom of flying into the beast giving it the ability to fly. Overall, Minthe appears to be quiet, somewhat reserved but endlessly fascinated by technology. This is evidenced by her interaction with [[Togi Aster\|Togi Aster]] where she willingly put her life in danger so she could gleam information out of him regarding Toasters and their manufacture. 
### Justice/Philosophy
> Minthe cares deeply for her little village back home. She wishes to create a machine capable of letting her village live without worry and that allows her to finally earn their respect. She subscribes to a carefree philosophy and having the freedom to do whatever she wants
### Romance
>Minthe has tried previously with the concept of Romance but has not found much success with it. No other information was given regarding this topic. She might be into romance if given sufficient opportunity?
