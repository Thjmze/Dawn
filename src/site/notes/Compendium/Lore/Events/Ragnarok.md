>![embed.jpg|right wm-sm](/img/user/Assets/Images/embed.jpg) The ground trembles beneath the dragon’s shadow, its wings vast enough to blot out the sun—yet no shade comes, only the unbearable radiance of its presence. The air shimmers with heat, warping the ruins of cities into grotesque mirages. The [[Aegis\|Aegis]], that colossal shield suspended between heaven and earth, glows white-hot, its edges dripping molten metal like falling stars. The pillars that hold it groan under the strain, their celestial foundations trembling.
>Beneath it, the world burns in slow motion.
>Mages gather in desperate circles, their hands raised to the bleeding sky, chanting spells that flicker and die in the dragon’s breath. Some try to summon storms, only for the rain to evaporate before it touches the ground. Others weave barriers of ice and shadow, but the heat unravels them like thread in a furnace. A few, maddened by the scale of the catastrophe, turn their magic inward—blinding themselves rather than witness the end.
>The streets are rivers of panic. People run, though there is nowhere left to flee. Buildings crumble into ash at a touch. The air itself is poison, searing lungs with every breath. Some fall to their knees, praying to gods who do not answer. Others scream, their voices lost beneath the roar of the inferno. A child clutches a charred doll, its glass eyes melted shut. A soldier, armor fused to his skin, stumbles forward before collapsing into embers.
>And through it all, the [[Aegis\|Aegis]] burns, its surface etched with ancient wards meant to hold back the unholdable. It was never meant to last forever—only long enough. But the dragon is patient. The shield will fail.
>As a celestial body slams into the sun, in what felt like  the first time in eons, the dragon falters. Its celestial fire sputters, its wings
>vast as solar flares—twist in agony. The impact sends shockwaves through its being, and for a moment, the world witnesses something impossible: _pain_ in a creature that had known only annihilation.
>Molten blood, thick as nebulae, spills from its jaws, cascading into the void in great, shimmering arcs. The Aegis shudders, its surface cracking like dried clay, but it holds—barely. The dragon’s body, once a perfect inferno, flickers like a guttering candle. Its golden eyes dim. It does not roar. It does not rage.
>It _retreats._
>With a final, shuddering breath, it turns toward the sun, its movements slow, wounded. The heat radiating from its body weakens, its flames receding like a tide pulling back from a ruined shore. The sky, once choked with fire and bleeding light, darkens—not to peace, but to an eerie, trembling quiet. The dragon folds its wings, its colossal form unraveling into streamers of dying plasma, and sinks into the sun’s embrace.
>The world watches.
>The Aegis, cracked and glowing faintly, still stands. The pillars groan as they crumble to ash. The air cools, though the ground remains scorched. Survivors emerge from shattered cities, their faces turned upward, not in relief—but in dread.
>Because they _know._
>This was not victory.
>The dragon sleeps.
>And when it wakes
> The world will burn oncemore. 
> **Yet, mere months after the event, the world clings to denial.**
> They know the truth—resistance is futile—but they bury it beneath hollow routines and desperate distractions. Some abandon their gods, spitting on altars that offered no salvation. Others pray harder, screaming into the void for a power mighty enough to stand against what comes. But when the name **[[Sol\|Sol]]** is spoken, even the divine fall silent.
> Cults rise in the dragon’s shadow, their followers prostrating themselves before the coming fire. They whisper of rebirth, of a world purged and renewed—a phoenix rising from the cinders. They call it mercy. They call it destiny.
> But the truth remains:
> **There is not a single soul untouched by its wrath.**
> Some still hope. They tell themselves the dragon will sleep forever. That when it wakes, it will turn its hunger elsewhere. Thata force like the —**[[Lore In Campaigns Past/The Flashborn\|The Flashborn]]**, will descend like a bolt of lightning to save them.
> But deep down, they know\
>A final dawn approaches
>And this time, there is no force strong enough to break it.
