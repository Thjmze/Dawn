[[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/The Sinners\|The Sinners]] are an organization that lies within the shadows of kingdoms and nations.  They are often called "The Concierges of Crime" due to their exceedingly large trade network. Often it seems purpose built to facilitate the crimes of other criminal syndicates. That is not to say they are not powerful. They do not advertise their wealth but it is assumed their largest vault in their multi-level network has inside 10 million gp which is rougly enough to buy out many small nations. Many fear or hate the sinners for their work as the facilitators of crime due to their utter dominance and monopoly over the supply of [[healing potions\|healing potions]]. While not much is known of the exact process of manufacture, this much is known: the brutality of the torture needed to produce one is enough for "[[The Factory\|The Factory]]" to be considered a place of horror worse than any of the nine hells. 

The Sinners are comprised of 12 Members known only by their codenames
