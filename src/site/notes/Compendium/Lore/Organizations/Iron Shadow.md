The Iron Shadow is a major criminal organization on Earth. Formed nearly 200 years ago by a collective of various destitute escapees from [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Gondwana/Dravinslagg/Dravinslagg\|Dravinslagg]], they decided they needed to make money and they needed to make money FAST. So in order to do so, they turned to crime. Primarily but not entirely based in [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Gondwana/Gondwana\|Gondwana]], they focus on the distribution and creation of the drug known as [[Veilbreak\|Veilbreak]]. They're known to be an exceptionally brutal organization when it comes to territorial conflicts and with their extreme discipline owing to their [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Gondwana/Dravinslagg/Dravinslaggian\|Dravinslaggian]] background and their experiences with the harsh leadership of the small island nation. However, the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Iron Shadow\|Iron Shadow]] does not particularly focus on solely drugs to create their fortune. Instead they may attempt to theive or assassinate if it allows them to further their goals of raising money for their upcoming war effort.

### Simulation of the [[Swordfish 2\|Swordfish 2]] Raid on Iron Shadow HQ
The simulation used most often for intermediate adventurer testing within the [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Vanyra/Vanyra\|Vanyra]] [[Adventurer’s Guild\|Adventurer’s Guild]], it showcases the [[Swordfish 2\|Swordfish 2]] raid on the headquartes of the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Iron Shadow\|Iron Shadow]]. This was a real raid that occurred in February 4th, 25 BR where Swordfish 2 (a group of special operatives led by [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Cixen Liu\|Cixen Liu]]) infiltrated the primary drug-making facility of the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Iron Shadow\|Iron Shadow]]. [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Cixen Liu\|Cixen Liu]] was an accomplished special operative who struck fear into the hearts of many criminal organizations due to his excellent combat strategy and tactical genius. Moreover, his unshakeable willpower led him to survive many situations in which others would not. The Iron Shadow as a result evacuated their headquarters (save for a few thousands prisoners forced to look like Iron Shadow members) and set up an ambush using bad information.  This raid would mark the end of Cixien Liu's career as a special operative when he found the heads of both his wife and daughter stitched to wooden marionettes. This also triggered the formation of the [[Stromhafen Decree\|Stromhafen Decree]] that applied to all special operatives working for the [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Dornfells\|Dornfells]] kingdom/nation.
