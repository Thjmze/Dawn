The Iron Shadow is a major criminal organization on Earth. Formed nearly 200 years ago by a collective of various destitute escapees from [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Gondwana/Dravinslagg/Dravinslagg\|Dravinslagg]], they decided they needed to make money and they needed to make money FAST. So in order to do so, they turned to crime. Primarily but not entirely based in Muriel, they focus on the distribution and creation of the drug known as [[Veilbreak\|Veilbreak]]. They're known to be an exceptionally brutal organization when it comes to territorial conflicts and with their extreme discipline owing to their [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Gondwana/Dravinslagg/Dravinslaggian\|Dravinslaggian]] background and their experiences with the harsh leadership of the small island nation.
