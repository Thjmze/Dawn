> The Union is the lead controller of the diamond supply within the upper [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Dornfells\|Dornfells]] region. Their previous leader, [[Fuuko Izumo\|Fuuko Izumo]] appeared to buy all of the diamond rich lands before anyone even knew about them. As though possessing precognition atleast according to some conspiracy theorists. The current leader [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico Nemuri]] is just as mysterious. The organization primarily focuses on distributing humanitarian aid to nations that are impoverished and fueling many research projects. Most Kingdoms have an uneasy truce with this private organization as they bring in a lot of employment in whatever area they are deployed and tend to generally stimulate the economy. Whilst their actions are good and generally helpful, their personnel seem extremely guarded and stoic. This has led to some distrust over the organization's true intentions. But people assume this might just be an aesthetic choice cultivated by the Union. The most notable project of the Union is a 100,000 gp project dedicated to the [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Lore In Campaigns Past/The Flashborn\|The Flashborn]] near the [[First Hammer\|First Hammer]] site. The reasons for this project are unknown.
