## Dwarves

Often found scattered across the world, Dwarves are known for their lively humor, their intricate craftsmanship and of course their mighty beards. Dwarves have been around for so long that little is known of their orgins. As the second oldest species (or third if you ask Elven anthropologists), Dwarves were foundational in many construction or crafting techniques used today. Their short stature made them excellent miners from the [[diamonds\|diamonds]] found miraculously in  the [[Arkane\|Arkane]] region to the cold icy tundras of the [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Jadagarr/Jadagarr\|Jadagarr]] territory, if there is an industry that needs miners or smiths, you will find atleast one dwarf there. There is a saying from before [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]] that went something like this "You could journey amongst the stars, land upon the grandest mountain and planet you have ever seen and at the base will be a dwarf mining for who knows what!". The saying's origin is unknown but the sentiment of Dwarves being anywhere and everywhere has been propagated for as long as history has been recorded. Their short stature betrays their impressive muscular density and metabolism. Dwarves often have 2 stomachs (literally) that help them digest and excrete food at a much faster rate than most. Impressively, in situations of extreme survival, it is said your average dwarven man could stay fed off a single slab of meat and a meagre slice of bred for a week before he hungers again. Now this isn't entirely accurate as this man would have to be practically comatose to complete such a feat but it is a testament to their natural aptitude for survival. Jokingly called beavers, they gain a deep primal satisfaction from construction and bending nature to their whim than even humans! However, some rural settlements utterly despise dwarves as people of all races trust Dwarven techniques over many others. Likewise they believe Dwarven handiwork to be superior to any other. This often results in the erasure of traditional techniques that may or may not be better than Dwarven techniques. 
Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure-for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.
Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.
Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.
Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.
