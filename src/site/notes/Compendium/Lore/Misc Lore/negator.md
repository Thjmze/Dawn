### Negators
Rare to encounter humanoids who have the power to negate certain concepts or phenomena in existence. Adventurers are best suited to fighting [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/UMA\|UMA]]s but negators are by far the most effective especially against an UMA they negate. Negation is thought to be past down through either ancestry or by "chosen" ancestry. In essence, the negator upon death can pass down their negation to a person they believe will make the most out of their ability. Before doing this, negators can temporarily glance into a web of possible futures to do so. This has resulted in some negator families wherein an entire bloodline would carry a negation. Other times it is well documented many key historical figures have also carried a negation. For example, Ryan McTavish, the king who forged the [[Chain of Acheron\|Chain of Acheron]] possessed or was speculated to possess the UnSleep negation which rendered him unable to sleep and gave him more time to devote to his craft of blacksmithing. This did not bode well for his small kingdom that was eventually reduced down to just a few hundred men during the Periamble War (a war fought against his nation and an unknown sentient white humanoid enemy called the Periamble) but did allow him enough time to create the powerful weapon that has since passed through the hands of many.  

Known Negators thus far:
[[Ichico Nemuri\|Unsleep]]
[[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Togi Aster\|UnToast]]
