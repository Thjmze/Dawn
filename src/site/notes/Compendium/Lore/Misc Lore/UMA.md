### Unidentified Mysterious Animal (player-version)
#misc 
In general knowledge, UMAs are strange abberations that appear in different parts of the world. They often appear to terrorize creatures in their surrounding area and often prey on civilizations nearby. They are a rare enough occurence that apart from the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Union\|Union]], no one has an explicit focus on hunting UMAs. Certain private interests attempt to exploit UMAs as they are a source of intense power if applied adequately. Though this is usually not worth the risk unless you have large amounts of resources to spare. Notably, through [[Thrain Farbe\|Thrain Farbe]] [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/The Sinners\|The Sinners]] attempted to capture [[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]]. Doctor [[Laika Stence\|Laika Stence]] is notable for her research in [[Arcane Geometry\|Arcane Geometry]] and having encountered UMAs in the field according to her [[LaikaxThrain Love Letter\|Love Letters]] that were uncovered by the party near [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Tolstoy/Tolstoy\|Tolstoy]]. 

#### Cultural signifiance
Small sects usually in uncontacted or "uncivilized" areas often incorporate UMAs into their mythos. Though these cults are often small and fizzle out when a UMA is killed. The most notable UMA-following cult is of [[UMA Death\|UMA Death]] who has a considerable worshipping of 1000 people across the continents. This cult believes in further her strength by enacting murder en-masse though it is unknown if she approves or not. The interaction with [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] does suggest she might have an inkling of support in this category. Some of her followers seem to have extreme power thought it isn't known if this is because of her interference or those with death-like abilities tend to gravitate towards her
