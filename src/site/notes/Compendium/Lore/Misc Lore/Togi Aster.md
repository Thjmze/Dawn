### Togi Aster
Head of the Aster Family of Toaster Fame, he once made the foolish decision to challenge the not-yet-founded [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Sub One Club\|Sub One Club]] in combat believing them to be assassins sent to kill him. He has a strong disdain for toasters made by the Giovanni, Drews, Medici or Perseus families.
