They arrive at Ellumin's hometown to find it plagued by an unnatural cold affecting the wildlife and his grandfather. Aided by his sister Lyra, the party investigates the strange affliction while discovering ancient lore about a "descender."                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Session Notes/Session 16 (2025-08-02)\|Session 16 (2025-08-02)]] | The Wasting of Durag 'Dral | August 25, 0002    | After planning their route to Durag'dral and buying supplies in Barovia, the party sets off with a new wagon and horses. They swiftly defeat a group of gnolls, during which Ellumin is reunited with his horse. The victory is soured when Card's magic necklace speaks an ominous phrase in an unknown language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Star started disabling the maze while avoiding clockwork hounds. Star found the Chain of Acheron (with unknown consequences) after breaking a dining table, while Johannes found love letters, and Vivi and Ellumin gathered magic items. An alarm sounded, forcing their escape through a tunnel. They surfaced, handed the chain to Ichico, and entered a safe house, where Ichico congratulated them and offered help getting home. Ellumin noted family issues up north. |

The Sub One Club entered the cave, battling a creature in the water before navigating building traps and Arcane Eyes, though Vivi and Ellumin triggered some. After a blinding sulfur room, Star's candle caused an explosion, alerting guards. A fight with The Sinners ensued, with Johannes and Urek leading the charge. The session ended with the party nearing the vault.                                                                                                                                                 |

They learned about the Sinners' train sabotage, the 90-minute heist's assets (radar, teleporter, bags of holding), cave dangers, and compound security (Arcane Eyes, puzzles). The vault has complex maze-key minigames. Baam requested they get explosives after Sozantos remained unimpressed. Later, a fountain incident led to a quick escape.                                                                                                                                        |

In **Svalich Woods**,they were flooded by reporters. They then found **Baam** and **Urek Mazino** (who joined for 10%). **Baam** revealed the **Sinners'** vault needs a blind maze and platform puzzle for entry.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Vivi overheard a heist plot. Ellumin and Zarude fixed a magically sabotaged engine, while Johannes and Card fought intruders and civilians died in the crossfire by the hands of the Iron Shadow. Guards arrived as the session ended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

They then investigated the black market, herbalist, magic shop, tailor, and information broker, gathering clues that point to Baam being in Svalich Woods, where they are now headed by train.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Their first quest for frost salamander meat hit a snag when they got drunk and **Card** relived a dragon attack nightmare. The salamanders were too tough, forcing a retreat and quest reassessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

# Homebrew Rule Reference

## 1. Character Creation Rules
- Everyone gains one free feat at 1st level (cannot be traded for an ASI); the **Lucky** feat is banned.
- Variant Human/Custom Lineage  is not allowed.
- Ability scores must use **standard array** or **point-buy**.
- All class features, rolls, and stats must be on your Roll20 sheet, even if you also use D&D Beyond.
- Sessions proceed with at least four players present.
## 2. Resource & Equipment Simplifications
- Ammunition isn’t tracked; buy more whenever you visit a shop.
- Material components are ignored—except when you need an item over 100gp to complete the spell
## 3. Class-Specific Tweaks
### Barbarian
- Bonus Action: You may strike yourself, taking damage equal to **half your barbarian level (rounded up)** to keep Rage active.
## 4. Spell Variants
### Phantasmal Force
- The illusion can impose a fitting **secondary condition** (e.g., water-filled diving helmet → **Deafened**).
- An illusion cannot impose two conditions at the same time (eg. Iron Maiden can only impose either a. Restrained or b. Blinded)
- The phantasm **moves with the target** even if that creature moves 15 ft.; it exists only within the victim’s mind.
## 5. Skill & Insight Rules
- Insight checks are rolled **secretly**
## 6. Traps & Environmental Interactions
- **Trap “click”**: When a trap readies, everyone  within the trap's effective range hears a click and may take **one stationary reaction** (e.g., crouch, raise shield). The choice may raise or lower the trap’s save DC, depending on the trap. For example crouching may reduce the DC on an over-head trap but heighten the DC on a false-floor trap
- **Falling onto a creature**:
  • Target makes a Dex save.  
    – **Success**: You take normal fall damage; target shifts 5 ft. in any direction.  
    – **Failure**: Same, **plus** the target also takes **double** the fall damage you suffered.
## 7. Combat Actions & Mechanics
- **Natural 20 on Initiative**: You may place yourself anywhere in the initiative order.
- **Player Critical Hits**: Roll damage normally, then **add the maximum value of the damage dice**.  
  *Example: Longsword crit → 1d8 + STR + 8.*
- **Last Stand**: While making death saves you may instantly **fail 2** saves to take **one action** (no self-healing).  
  • Attacks auto-hit and crit.  
  • Spells are cast two levels higher without using a slot.
- **Flanking**: Grants the people on opposite sides of an enemy advantage. In addition, ranged attacks (ie more than 10ft away) gain a +2 to hit b/c imagine trying to defend two sides at once + getting shot at?? Sucks ass fr fr
- **Hidden HP & Death Saves**:  
  • HP is described narratively (“bleeding heavily”); numbers stay secret from other players.  
  • Death saves are rolled **to GM only**.  
  • *When casting a healing spell*, you may reveal HP to avoid overheal.
- **Healing Options**:  
  • **Out of combat**: all healing dice with the exception of short rest are treated as maximum.  
  • **In combat**: choose **bonus action (roll)** or **action (max)**
- **Magical Revival**: Any magical healing immediately restores consciousness if (1) HP regained exceeds negative HP **and** (2) incapacitation was caused by damage (not effects like *Hypnotic Pattern*).
## 8. Death & Narrative Flavor
- Whenever you roll a death save—pass **or** fail—describe a memory that flashes before your eyes.

>![[embed.jpg\|right wm-sm]] The ground trembles beneath the dragon’s shadow, its wings vast enough to blot out the sun—yet no shade comes, only the unbearable radiance of its presence. The air shimmers with heat, warping the ruins of cities into grotesque mirages. The [[Aegis\|Aegis]], that colossal shield suspended between heaven and earth, glows white-hot, its edges dripping molten metal like falling stars. The pillars that hold it groan under the strain, their celestial foundations trembling.
>Beneath it, the world burns in slow motion.
>Mages gather in desperate circles, their hands raised to the bleeding sky, chanting spells that flicker and die in the dragon’s breath. Some try to summon storms, only for the rain to evaporate before it touches the ground. Others weave barriers of ice and shadow, but the heat unravels them like thread in a furnace. A few, maddened by the scale of the catastrophe, turn their magic inward—blinding themselves rather than witness the end.
>The streets are rivers of panic. People run, though there is nowhere left to flee. Buildings crumble into ash at a touch. The air itself is poison, searing lungs with every breath. Some fall to their knees, praying to gods who do not answer. Others scream, their voices lost beneath the roar of the inferno. A child clutches a charred doll, its glass eyes melted shut. A soldier, armor fused to his skin, stumbles forward before collapsing into embers.
>And through it all, the [[Aegis\|Aegis]] burns, its surface etched with ancient wards meant to hold back the unholdable. It was never meant to last forever—only long enough. But the dragon is patient. The shield will fail.
>As a celestial body slams into the sun, in what felt like  the first time in eons, the dragon falters. Its celestial fire sputters, its wings
>vast as solar flares—twist in agony. The impact sends shockwaves through its being, and for a moment, the world witnesses something impossible: _pain_ in a creature that had known only annihilation.
>Molten blood, thick as nebulae, spills from its jaws, cascading into the void in great, shimmering arcs. The Aegis shudders, its surface cracking like dried clay, but it holds—barely. The dragon’s body, once a perfect inferno, flickers like a guttering candle. Its golden eyes dim. It does not roar. It does not rage.
>It _retreats._
>With a final, shuddering breath, it turns toward the sun, its movements slow, wounded. The heat radiating from its body weakens, its flames receding like a tide pulling back from a ruined shore. The sky, once choked with fire and bleeding light, darkens—not to peace, but to an eerie, trembling quiet. The dragon folds its wings, its colossal form unraveling into streamers of dying plasma, and sinks into the sun’s embrace.
>The world watches.
>The Aegis, cracked and glowing faintly, still stands. The pillars groan as they crumble to ash. The air cools, though the ground remains scorched. Survivors emerge from shattered cities, their faces turned upward, not in relief—but in dread.
>Because they _know._
>This was not victory.
>The dragon sleeps.
>And when it wakes
> The world will burn oncemore. 
> **Yet, mere months after the event, the world clings to denial.**
> They know the truth—resistance is futile—but they bury it beneath hollow routines and desperate distractions. Some abandon their gods, spitting on altars that offered no salvation. Others pray harder, screaming into the void for a power mighty enough to stand against what comes. But when the name **[[Sol\|Sol]]** is spoken, even the divine fall silent.
> Cults rise in the dragon’s shadow, their followers prostrating themselves before the coming fire. They whisper of rebirth, of a world purged and renewed—a phoenix rising from the cinders. They call it mercy. They call it destiny.
> But the truth remains:
> **There is not a single soul untouched by its wrath.**
> Some still hope. They tell themselves the dragon will sleep forever. That when it wakes, it will turn its hunger elsewhere. Thata force like the —**[[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Lore In Campaigns Past/The Flashborn\|The Flashborn]]**, will descend like a bolt of lightning to save them.
> But deep down, they know\
>A final dawn approaches
>And this time, there is no force strong enough to break it.
