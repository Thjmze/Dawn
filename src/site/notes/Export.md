# Homebrew Rule Reference

## 1. Character Creation Rules
- Everyone gains one free feat at 1st level (cannot be traded for an ASI); the **Lucky** feat is banned.
- Variant Human/Custom Lineage  is not allowed.
- Ability scores must use **standard array** or **point-buy**.
- All class features, rolls, and stats must be on your Roll20 sheet, even if you also use D&D Beyond.
- Sessions proceed with at least four players present.
## 2. Resource & Equipment Simplifications
- Ammunition isn’t tracked; buy more whenever you visit a shop.
- Material components are ignored—except when you need an item over 100gp to complete the spell
## 3. Class-Specific Tweaks
### Barbarian
- Bonus Action: You may strike yourself, taking damage equal to **half your barbarian level (rounded up)** to keep Rage active.
## 4. Spell Variants
### Phantasmal Force
- The illusion can impose a fitting **secondary condition** (e.g., water-filled diving helmet → **Deafened**).
- An illusion cannot impose two conditions at the same time (eg. Iron Maiden can only impose either a. Restrained or b. Blinded)
- The phantasm **moves with the target** even if that creature moves 15 ft.; it exists only within the victim’s mind.
## 5. Skill & Insight Rules
- Insight checks are rolled **secretly**
## 6. Traps & Environmental Interactions
- **Trap “click”**: When a trap readies, everyone  within the trap's effective range hears a click and may take **one stationary reaction** (e.g., crouch, raise shield). The choice may raise or lower the trap’s save DC, depending on the trap. For example crouching may reduce the DC on an over-head trap but heighten the DC on a false-floor trap
- **Falling onto a creature**:
  • Target makes a Dex save.  
    – **Success**: You take normal fall damage; target shifts 5 ft. in any direction.  
    – **Failure**: Same, **plus** the target also takes **double** the fall damage you suffered.
## 7. Combat Actions & Mechanics
- **Natural 20 on Initiative**: You may place yourself anywhere in the initiative order.
- **Player Critical Hits**: Roll damage normally, then **add the maximum value of the damage dice**.  
  *Example: Longsword crit → 1d8 + STR + 8.*
- **Last Stand**: While making death saves you may instantly **fail 2** saves to take **one action** (no self-healing).  
  • Attacks auto-hit and crit.  
  • Spells are cast two levels higher without using a slot.
- **Hidden HP & Death Saves**:  
  • HP is described narratively (“bleeding heavily”); numbers stay secret from other players.  
  • Death saves are rolled **to GM only**.  
  • *When casting a healing spell*, you may reveal HP to avoid overheal.
- **Healing Options**:  
  • **Out of combat**: all healing dice with the exception of short rest are treated as maximum.  
  • **In combat**: choose **bonus action (roll)** or **action (max)**
- **Magical Revival**: Any magical healing immediately restores consciousness if (1) HP regained exceeds negative HP **and** (2) incapacitation was caused by damage (not effects like *Hypnotic Pattern*).
## 8. Death & Narrative Flavor
- Whenever you roll a death save—pass **or** fail—describe a memory that flashes before your eyes.

###### Ragnarok
<span class="sub2">:FasCross: Religious Event</span>
___

> [!quote|no-t]
>![[embed.jpg\|right wm-sm]] The ground trembles beneath the dragon’s shadow, its wings vast enough to blot out the sun—yet no shade comes, only the unbearable radiance of its presence. The air shimmers with heat, warping the ruins of cities into grotesque mirages. The [[Aegis\|Aegis]], that colossal shield suspended between heaven and earth, glows white-hot, its edges dripping molten metal like falling stars. The pillars that hold it groan under the strain, their celestial foundations trembling.
>Beneath it, the world burns in slow motion.
>Mages gather in desperate circles, their hands raised to the bleeding sky, chanting spells that flicker and die in the dragon’s breath. Some try to summon storms, only for the rain to evaporate before it touches the ground. Others weave barriers of ice and shadow, but the heat unravels them like thread in a furnace. A few, maddened by the scale of the catastrophe, turn their magic inward—blinding themselves rather than witness the end.
>The streets are rivers of panic. People run, though there is nowhere left to flee. Buildings crumble into ash at a touch. The air itself is poison, searing lungs with every breath. Some fall to their knees, praying to gods who do not answer. Others scream, their voices lost beneath the roar of the inferno. A child clutches a charred doll, its glass eyes melted shut. A soldier, armor fused to his skin, stumbles forward before collapsing into embers.
>And through it all, the [[Aegis\|Aegis]] burns, its surface etched with ancient wards meant to hold back the unholdable. It was never meant to last forever—only long enough. But the dragon is patient. The shield will fail.
>As a celestial body slams into the sun, in what felt like  the first time in eons, the dragon falters. Its celestial fire sputters, its wings
>vast as solar flares—twist in agony. The impact sends shockwaves through its being, and for a moment, the world witnesses something impossible: _pain_ in a creature that had known only annihilation.
>Molten blood, thick as nebulae, spills from its jaws, cascading into the void in great, shimmering arcs. The Aegis shudders, its surface cracking like dried clay, but it holds—barely. The dragon’s body, once a perfect inferno, flickers like a guttering candle. Its golden eyes dim. It does not roar. It does not rage.
>It _retreats._
>With a final, shuddering breath, it turns toward the sun, its movements slow, wounded. The heat radiating from its body weakens, its flames receding like a tide pulling back from a ruined shore. The sky, once choked with fire and bleeding light, darkens—not to peace, but to an eerie, trembling quiet. The dragon folds its wings, its colossal form unraveling into streamers of dying plasma, and sinks into the sun’s embrace.
>The world watches.
>The Aegis, cracked and glowing faintly, still stands. The pillars groan as they crumble to ash. The air cools, though the ground remains scorched. Survivors emerge from shattered cities, their faces turned upward, not in relief—but in dread.
>Because they _know._
>This was not victory.
>The dragon sleeps.
>And when it wakes
> The world will burn oncemore. 
> **Yet, mere months after the event, the world clings to denial.**
> They know the truth—resistance is futile—but they bury it beneath hollow routines and desperate distractions. Some abandon their gods, spitting on altars that offered no salvation. Others pray harder, screaming into the void for a power mighty enough to stand against what comes. But when the name **[[Sol\|Sol]]** is spoken, even the divine fall silent.
> Cults rise in the dragon’s shadow, their followers prostrating themselves before the coming fire. They whisper of rebirth, of a world purged and renewed—a phoenix rising from the cinders. They call it mercy. They call it destiny.
> But the truth remains:
> **There is not a single soul untouched by its wrath.**
> Some still hope. They tell themselves the dragon will sleep forever. That when it wakes, it will turn its hunger elsewhere. Thata force like the —**[[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Lore In Campaigns Past/The Flashborn\|The Flashborn]]**, will descend like a bolt of lightning to save them.
> But deep down, they know\
>A final dawn approaches
>And this time, there is no force strong enough to break it.

###### Session 1
<span class="sub2">:FasSun: DAY 00 &nbsp; | &nbsp; :FasTags: []</span>
___

> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>The story begins at the aforementioned [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Lore In Campaigns Past/portal\|portal]] of our party's primary realm starrting [[Minthe Thistlestep\|Minthe Thistlestep]], [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]], [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]], [[Vivienne La Tour  \|Vivienne La Tour  ]]], and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|"Wild Card"]]. All of them were contacted in some way or another during the [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Lore In Campaigns Past/Nexian Portal Crisis\|Nexian Portal Crisis]] by different parties and asked/ordered to come here with the notable exception of [[Vivienne La Tour  \|Vivienne La Tour  ]]. When they see many people seemingly unable to enter the portal, including some very powerful individuals, they decide to try and get in. A nearby guide tells them that the goal is to just enter the portal and see what is behind the crisis. It should be very brief and not at all dangeroius.
>They come into this new world [[Earth\|Earth]] but in doing so they feel a [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/strange dark force\|strange dark force]] grip their hearts and squeeze it. They come into contact with their first foe, a man who claims to be a [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/negator\|negator]] with the power of [[UnToast\|UnToast]]. The party does not fully understand this concept yet.
>After a swift defeat of this foe, a member of the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Knights Moralis\|Knights Moralis]] named [[Mualani Ibarareth\|Mualani Ibarareth]]  confronts them and is about to apprehend one of them for doing an act of [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Forbidden Magic\|Forbidden Magic]]. They meet [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico Nemuri]] who appears to be an ally. 
>To stop this, she asks her daughter [[Mico Vorgeil\|Mico Vorgeil]] to cast a memory erasure [[Spell\|Spell]]. Once they escape they are told of [[Sol\|Sol]] and his influence on the World. Through various apocalyptic events, including one called [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]], God has created and destroyed the world many times over until the most recent one. A previous group  (now called the [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Lore In Campaigns Past/The Flashborn\|The Flashborn]]) who also came in through a portal to knock out God and stop [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]]. Regardless, now [Sol] has captured Ichico's friends through [[UMA Soul\|UMA Soul]] who is a creature called a [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/UMA\|UMA]]. 
>Ichico talks about how her friends and colleagues used to be part of an organization called the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Union\|Union]] but now it is all but gone thanks to the capture of many of its members. She speaks of how the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Union\|Union]] would partake in quests to defeat UMAs and gain [[Artifacts\|Artifacts]] that will give them the power to kill [[Sol\|Sol]]. She asks the party for their aid and in return, they will be provided food and board as well a tidy sum of gold. While hesistant at first, the party eventually concedes and agrees to help. Their first target is a [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/UMA\|UMA]] called "[[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]]"

###### Session 02
<span class="sub2">:FasSun: DAY 01 &nbsp; | &nbsp; :FasTags: []</span>
___

> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>In the night, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] enters his memories and meets someone, who, after seeing a memory not in a soul, grants him a boon. Meanwhile, a little bit of worldbuilding is created, on how potions are made. The sigils themselves dilute into the potion, and so the magic activates the sigils upon consumption. Neat. [[Potion-Making Process\|Potion-Making Process]]
>However, this night is no longer a peaceful one, as the town of [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Sapone/Sapone\|Sapone]] is raided by a group of [[gnolls\|gnolls]], humanoid hyena people, as many civilians and soldiers are being killed and eaten. Once the party defends themselves through combat, with some highlights including a nearly dead ally, catapulting one ally into a group of enemies, a human flag of death, and a desperate but failing attempt to break ACLs, we come across the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Knights Moralis\|Knights Moralis]], and [[Mualani\|Mualani]], an officer whom we met, as well as someone who's daughter has been kidnapped, a blonde woman with a notable scar across her eye, whose name is [[Calysta\|Calysta]]. The [[gnolls\|gnolls]] have taken her to some place unknown, and asks our party to rescue her.
>And so, our party leaves the town, following the path of corpses and blood, to find [[Calysta\|Calysta]], and the [[gnolls\|gnolls]] who kidnapped her. On this trek, we also come to learn of a few more things. The day, July 26, is also known as the [[Night of the Falling Stars\|Night of the Falling Stars]], the summer solstice. On this day, crime rates may have increased, people go missing more often, and yet, festivals are abound at this time. In addition, Ichico and the party make note of something: The gnolls' blood was different. Orange blood. The same is true to the casualties they find along the path, with either a deep, bright red or a light purple colouring of their blood. It is suspected that [[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]] has something to do with this.
>Once the trail of weirdly coloured blood ends, the party decides to head in the direction of the ruins near [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Tolstoy/Tolstoy\|Tolstoy]], an abandoned fortress. Once inside, the party finds gnoll claw marks, seems they were here. We also come to note the fire and light in these ruins, each with uncommon colours, blue, green, pure yellow, and the fire does not burn creatures. A not heating fire (at least the blue one, haven't tested the others).

###### Session O3 
<span class="sub2">:FasSun: DAY 01 &nbsp; | &nbsp; :FasTags: []</span>
___

> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>We come across various letters between a cryptologist, [[Thrain Farbe\|Thrain Farbe]], and their wife, [[Laika Spades\|Laika Spades]], posthumously. They have died for a while, and Laika comes to them eventually after their death, urging further explorers to kill [[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]] and destroy the ruins. In the letters, [[Thrain Farbe\|Thrain]] becomes insane over the removal of the barriers and the colours.
>[[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]], throwing herself in danger, almost falls into a spike trap, gets run over by a spiky rock, and by being raised in a temple, does not know Chinese. Unfortunate. 
>After one colourful light puzzle, the door opens and turns transparent, as we find [[Calysta\|Calysta]], trapped by coloured ropes on an altar. She was constantly begging for help. It felt very cliche, and in fact, felt too cliche. So instead, the party futzed around for a really long time holding open a door, digging a hole, and finding a letter which indicates that Laika rigged traps within the ruins, the same traps the party (or more specifically, Star) has encountered.
>Turns out, [[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]] disguised itself as [[Calysta\|Calysta]], and so the party fought (minus [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Vivienne La Tour\|Vivi]] who was still trying to keep a door open). Star immediately collapsed right in front of the boss. [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] nearly got downed. [[Vivienne La Tour  \|Vivienne La Tour  ]] finally opened that door and dealt the final blow to [[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]].

###### Session 04
<span class="sub2">:FasSun: DAY 02 &nbsp; | &nbsp; :FasTags: []</span>
___

> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>We recuperate on the way back to [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Sapone/Sapone\|Sapone]], and meet up with [[Calysta\|Calysta]]'s father who requested help. He thanks us, and points to the capital up north for resupplies of [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]]' revolver ammo, since the bullets are fairly advanced for the setting. [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico]] suspects something about [[Laika Spades\|Laika]], and intends to report to the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Union\|Union]] about it. She leaves the party for their own devices, saying 'the records aren't right'
>[[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] has a great desire to get a stuffed animal. She asks the gate guard patrolling the upper area where the toy store owner is to buy one. Despite her desperation, asking the guard didn't help as he informs her of how insensitive/crass her actions were considering the recent tragedy that just occured. She comes back to the inn. 
>[[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] follows [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico]] for a follow up on what she's saying. He is informed that [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico]] is also not of the current realm, in a sense. Asking for an explanation on [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/UMA\|UMAs]], [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] learns that despite [[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]] dying, there is still colour in the world. That is because Colour is a [[Master Rule\|Master Rule]], where, despite dying, the concept that they represent continues. There are also the [[Superior Rules\|Superior Rules]], a being above Master Rules, like [[UMA Death\|UMA Death]], which perpetually exist. Ichico has further claims that, under [[King Irmin\|King Irmin]], there is no [[arcane geometry\|arcane geometry]] researcher named Laika, and so something must be up with this individual. UMA Colour could not have killed a body in such a way, and talks to JOHANNES about her findings.
>[[Vivienne La Tour \|Vivi]] and [[Minthe Thistlestep\|Minthe Thistlestep]] go out for inventory cleanup, and find extra scraps outside the gate. Vivi asks Minthe on trying to create a specialized grappling hook, and talks about how focusing is really hard.
>The next day, [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico]] brings the party out to a ship to leave to the nearest Union base, near [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Vanyra/Vanyra\|Vanyra]]. Unfortunately, the shopkeeper is swindling the party, but [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] is very scary, and brings it up to the captain, who is also doing business. [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] is less scary this time, but did get a discount on the fare. The party then travels the rest of the day to [[Arcan Gate\|Arcan Gate]], but doesn't stop there, and makes for [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Vanyra/Vanyra\|Vanyra]].
>The party finds a group of bandits from a crime organization called the [[Sinners\|Sinners]], and they converse about finding a date for a gala. Also something about the [[Chain of Acheron\|Chain of Acheron]] and the transportation of said artifact.
>They skip camping with the bandits, and arrive near [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Vanyra/Vanyra\|Vanyra]], entering the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Union\|Union]] base, a tower. In the interim, some members proceed to make sleeping arrangements featuring one person on one queen-size bed, and the party everywhere else. After a short tour of the tower, and a completing of the Quest, we come to track an artifact, the aforementioned [[Chain of Acheron\|Chain of Acheron]], on rails along the route of [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Jadagarr/Jadagarr\|Jadagarr]] on the train called the [[Snowpiercer\|Snowpiercer]], owned by the [[Sinners\|Sinners]]. Also, they are currently holding onto basically all of the healing potions. A lot of people have been used as livestock to harvest more potions. They are the ones who are producing it.
>The party now has a new mission: stealing the [[Chain of Acheron\|Chain of Acheron]] from them. The [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Union\|Union]] cannot interfere directly, but the party, being 'technically' independent, can. They are given a safe-ish route, a more risky route, and a very risky route. Route one, Train Heist, break in, reap havoc, leave. Route two, warehouse. Much stealthier, more elite foes. Route three, gala. Even more rewards, even riskier foes.
>After some discussion, it eventually was decided that the second route, the warehouse, was the route to go. The party is given a point of contact to a shady tavern to begin.

>Upon arriving at The [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Vanyra/Angel's Share/Angel's Share\|Angel's Share]], [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] believes the dragon statue at the front is a weird-looking sheep, much to the dismay of [[Minthe Thistlestep\|Minthe Thistlestep]] and the others, and, entering, find a small group speaking in code to rob the party, which [[Vivienne La Tour \|Vivi]] informs the rest. They find [[Compendium/NPC's/Sozantos\|Sozantos]], who complains about the party to Larry over bar etiquette. [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] look at a lamp in the corner and the vent on the ceiling.
>[[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] makes a plan to contact [[Compendium/NPC's/Sozantos\|Sozantos]] in an attempt to confirm that they are, in fact, the contact. They are, but doesn't trust the party, for being too inexperienced, too weak looking. After telling the bartender a passphrase, we get directions to an underground arena to gain the trust of our contact. After stealing a dagger from that small group, the party peacefully makes their way down the steps to the arena.
>The crowd clamours over Voss, a blacksmith fighter in the arena, who won the fight. The party will participate in the fight, with [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] being the main fighter, and the others as support. After an intense planning session, the fight begins. Card completely decimates the foe, a small kobold, and now bets are open for other fights. The second round begins, and Card fights once again. The orc opponent and their summons continue the fight, all the while [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] continually insults their haircut, as they were being racist to Card, but Card still wins.
>The third fight is much more tough, and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] is downed on the first attack. After a very close struggle, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] survives and barely kills the final foe, a death cultist who chants out to [[UMA Death\|UMA Death]] upon his death.  She has lived through the fights, earned the money, and earned the trust of [[Compendium/NPC's/Sozantos\|Sozantos]].

>Session 6 Summary  
>The party is given a set of contacts from [[Compendium/NPC's/Sozantos\|Sozantos]] for the heist.  
>Floor Plans -Ida Kitagawa 15% - The notes are more basic, and more so run on intuition. If we do a good job, she'll offer a lower rate of 10%. 
>Juven Hien 15% - The notes are much more comprehensive. However, if we do a bad job, he'll require a higher cut of 20%.  
>Tool Provider
>Baam 10% - It's at a cheaper rate, but we must look for them first.
> Endorsi 20% - Also very reliable in preparation, but at a higher rate. 
>  Expert -Urek Mazino ??% - A dangerous individual, whom we will contact their assistant. How much he will ask is random and unpredictable
>   Sozantos 10% as a commissioner's fee. 
>    For now, the party has chosen Juven Hien for the floor plans, and our meeting with him will occur in a week. They are also considering to go on the hunt for Baam. In the meantime, with the party still considered weak, they must prepare and get stronger. In addition, [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/The Sinners\|The Sinners]] would be hot on their tail, like with the [[WallFacers\|WallFacers]], whom no one knows about. They are told to go to the [[Adventurer's guild\|Adventurer's guild]] to register, as well as a place to stay. The inn that is considered cheap is the party's choice, and was able to reduce the number of rooms to rent to two.  After a long night's rest, and a long cooking session with a fish and herbs, the party arrives at the adventurer's guild for registration. At registration, the party needs to decide on a party name.  And so, they have dubbed themselves the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Sub One Club\|Sub One Club]].  As a test of abilities, they are to undergo a simulation in a lower floor. After going down a ladder hidden in the globe in the guild building, they enter the simulation room, and start the test. In addition, there are mystery panels on the ground.

> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>Session 7 Summary:  The simulation begins. On choosing two fights, the party chooses the easier fight at first, and the harder fighter afterwards.  The easier fight is one against a captain of longer ago -  [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Cixen Liu\|Cixen Liu]].  The [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Iron Shadow\|Iron Shadow]] members are then met with a swift end, with the final foe dissolving in acid.  Two figures, a woman and child watch in the distance as the simulation ends, their faces sewen onto mannequins.    Immediately jumping into the next simulation, the party finds themselves at a dungeon named '[[The Ruins of Xilabia\|The Ruins of Xilabia]]'. Two guardians are in the ruins, named Bacchus and Argos, and the party is expected to undergo the test of Pythagoras - to defeat them in battle. A sharp volley of arrows come, hurting [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]], but the party makes quick work of Bacchus, and shifts over to Argos, who also shoots a lightning enchanted arrow into the air.  The arrow warps [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] to other spaces, where the fight continues. Unfortunately, both [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Vivienne La Tour\|Vivi]] keep entering the wrong space to aid in the fight for a while, before finishing the combat simulation.   And so, the Sub One Club are now official adventurers in this world, able to take on commissions from the guild. There are currently three quests on the board that seem good: Catching a Frost Salamander for a date in 3 days, finding a missing tome with a modified Fireball spell, and an urgent quest for a crypt clearing.  There's also looking for [[Baam\|Baam]] and a few other projects, and so the party is left deliberating what to do.

> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>Session 8 Summary:  The party decides to do some shopping before starting out on a quest. At the forge, managed by a fire elemental, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Vivienne La Tour\|Vivi]] uses most of her money for additional weapons and armor, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] resupplies their javelins for a steal, and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] exchanges one of his revolvers with a hand crossbow, and accompanying ammo. At the magic item shop, managed by a harengon, [[Hon Rosie Booker\|Hon Rosie Booker]], who has a grandson who wants to enroll in a wizard's academy. Minthe talks about her own past as an artificer as well, buying a pair of night owl's half-moon spectacles and a stuffed familiar, with a luna moth cape on hold, and a glass carver watched. The artificer who made the glasses is named Luo Ji. She also lends Hon some teaching materials for the grandson.  Back at the adventurer's guild, Eleena (the one on the right, the one on the left is Allayna) is quite busy with other adventurers, and The Sub One Club officially accepts their first commission, to help a man get some frost salamander meat. On the way to the location of the salamander, they come across a group of drunken bards, and Vivi, Card, and Minthe get drunk, and Card taking an additional scotch, enters a nightmare of the past, where a dragon attacks a brewmaster's home.  
>> [!info]- Flashback  
> You feel a nauseating feeling come over you, your vision goes black and you wake up as a Brewmaster checking up on his wine cellar/distillery. You hear two giant booms outside and you rush to your bedroom door to look outside. When you look outside through your bedroom window, the sky is a deep shade of red and you see two extremely big pillars fashioned in the shape of hammers within 40km of your little abode. On top of it seems to be an object you can't make out. As you feel a small sense of safety, a dragon's claw seems to hit the top of this structure and a shockwave is created. You duck for cover as the glass of your window seems to shatter. Picking yourself up from the fragments, you see fire rapidly spreading out towards your home. The luscious green landscape now set ablaze (likely spread as a result of the shockwave)
> 
>Entering the cave, the party comes across two frost salamanders. However, while it may seem some headway is made, the frost salamanders proved to be too much for the party, and so they made a hasty retreat to give a report to the adventurer's guild over a reassessment of the difficulty.

###### Session 09
<span class="sub2">:FasSun: DAY 00 &nbsp; | &nbsp; :FasTags: []</span>
___

> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>  After a rocky dam broke, flooding their cave, the [[ Sub One Club\| Sub One Club]] resurfaced in the middle of a snow storm. Needing shelter, they headed toward nearby ruins and set up a temporary camp. While taking watch shifts, Vivi noticed a strange phenomenon in the Aurora Borealis—an eerie snake-like movement coiling through the northern lights.
>  Earlier, the party successfully hunted and butchered a limping frost salamander, yielding about **247.9 lbs of meat** (84.4 + 116.5 + 47) and approximately **10.98 lbs of skin**. Though they had far more meat than needed, they kept as much as they could and sold the leftovers + skin around town, each making about **53 gp and 8 silver**. Upon returning to the [[Adventurer’s Guild\|Adventurer’s Guild]], they gave 100 lbs of meat to Allayna, who questioned their sanity for butchering so much when only a few pounds would suffice for the quest of procuring some meat for a man's date with a common rural woman he wanted to impress (though Allayna believes him to be kinda pathetic/sweet). 
>  The party then split into pairs to sell their goods throughout town before regrouping to meet with [[Juven Hien\|Juven Hien]]. Juven pressed them on their bold plan to rob the [[Sinners\|Sinners]], a ruthless criminal organization that punishes any of those who dare to challenge them.  The reason behind the heist is [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico Nemuri]]’s request: she wants the [[Chain of Acheron\|Chain of Acheron]] stolen from the Sinners. Ichico is connected to the Sinners due to their near-monopoly on health potions and thus is unable to conduct this heist herself but she can do it cold-war style using the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Sub One Club\|Sub One Club]]
>  Juven shared how Sozantos once saved his ass from a sting operation by the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Knights Moralis\|Knights Moralis]], who would erase memories of anyone caught. After finally gaining his respect despite his belief that adventurers are just beefy dirty hunks who don't have the elegance of a true criminal, Juven negotiated a **15% cut** from the heist’s proceeds. He spoke of “The Big One” — the Sinners’ vault headquarters rumored to hold **200 million gp**, enough to topple or buy a small nation. While Juven and Sozantos escaped when things went south, [[Baam\|Baam]] who is described as a tall sneaky half-orc was caught, explaining his long disappearance. His current whereabouts remain unknown and Juven joked he may or may not be dead at this point. 
>  The party finalized plans to utilize **Radar systems, Teleportation Portals (TP Portals), and sabotage the Sinners’ alarm systems** to maximize their chances. They chose to enter through the cave, go underwater to avoid detection and break into the building using the main entrance to the underground sewage system. [[Juven Hien\|Juven Hien]] remarked that the magical vault was so advanced in its lock-breaking strategy it has to be done in coordination with a team which after it goes through a magical decrypter, will look like a maze that the team will have to navigate someone through who cannot see the map. In addition, he mentioned quite crypticially that there is a section that involves disappearing walls, a ghost and strange mechanics. 
>  Next steps include finding [[Baam\|Baam]], recruiting the wild card:  [[Compendium/NPC's/Urek Mazino\|Urek Mazino]], and continuing to refine the heist strategy.
Mechanics



#### Juven Hien Explaining his debt to Sozantos
"I owed Sozantos a favour and he asked me to take you folks in to rob this joint. If it wasn't for him realizing the Dornfells Vault was a sting operation by the Knights Moralis, I would've been toast. For crimes like ours, they would've erased your memory till you barely know who you are anymore. I'm sure he's already impressed on you that this isn't a petty venture but I'll reiterate. The sinners ain't the ones one should be messing with. If I had a connection for every single person that has died trying to break into that vault alone, I'd have built an information network even larger than the one I have now.

##### Mechanics:
1. There is a clock that goes up by 1 minute after a combat and for every non-combat action you take. You will trade in minutes for the amount of money you steal from the vault. 
2. The alert level determines how fucked you are. As you heighten the alert level, you will encounter more obstacles such as increased guard patrol, more traps (some of which cannot be detected) or reinforcements who arrive at alert level 3 but do not actively know your location until Alert level 4.  They are the same level of difficulty as two frost salamanders (aka super fucked)
3. The maze will consist of people trying to maneuver someone through a labyrinth except one person will not have vision for the whole endeavour causing them to see a whole different map than the rest. This means you must coordinate tactically. In addition, the maze might have invisible obstacles to completion, a defense system including enemies amongst various other lovely things. 
4. The radar shows nearby traps but does not have high precision. 


# Heist Mini-Game Mechanical Summary

---

## 1. **Approach Structure**

- **Two main approaches:**
    
    - **Bottom Up** (3 sequential choices)
        
    - **Top Down** (3 sequential choices)
        
- Each approach consists of **3 choices (tokens)** with 3 possible numerical values each (low, mid, high).
    

---

## 2. **Token Values**

- Each choice is associated with three possible token values representing the quality or cleverness of the plan.
    
- Tokens are drawn from predefined sets (e.g., Cave: 2/3/5; City Catacombs: 5/7/8; etc.).
    

---

## 3. **Skill Checks to Unlock Tokens**

- Skill check **DC = 13 (Moderate difficulty)** recommended
    
- Players roll relevant skills (Stealth, Athletics, etc.) to reveal and activate tokens
    
- Failure to activate a token means the pathway/token is lost (cannot be used)
    

---

## 4. **Turn Economy**

- **Each token requires:**
    
    - **1 turn to reveal + 1 turn to activate**, or
        
    - **1 turn to gamble activate blindly (no reveal)**
        
- **Recommended turns per player:**
    
    - **4 players:** 4 turns each (total 16 turns)
        
    - **5 players:** 3 turns each (total 15 turns)
        
    - **6 players:** 3 turns each plus extra turn (total ~18 turns)
        
- Turn management encourages balancing risk vs safety (gamble vs reveal)
    

---

## 5. **Outcome Thresholds (Cumulative Token Sum)**

### Adjusted for approx 20% best success:

|Outcome|Bottom Up Threshold|Top Down Threshold|
|---|---|---|
|**Best**|Sum ≥ 17|Sum ≥ 16|
|**Acceptable**|Sum 12 – 16|Sum 11 – 15|
|**Worst**|Sum ≤ 11|Sum ≤ 10|

End of Planning: Okay so you'll need a fair bit of equipment

Need Magical Decrypter 
Choose 3
-  You'll need a selective magic reuptake inhibitor 
-  Need a way to knock out guards
-  Trap/Radar detector
-  Radar upgrader
-  Poison Water supply (extra time)
-  TP portals 
-  Sabotage Alarm Systems (extra alert levels)
- False Decoy 
-  Bigger bag

> The Flashborn is the unofficial name of a series of people who were the first to experience the [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Lore In Campaigns Past/Nexian Portal Crisis\|Nexian Portal Crisis]]. These individuls were forcibly taken from their current location when a portal opened up nearby. The most notable member is [[Ilya\|Ilya]] who has a connection with [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]]. Once they entered these portals, they were taken into a version of [[Earth\|Earth]] in the year 2017. [[Ichico Nemuri\|Ichico Nemuri]] and [[Mico Vorgeil\|Mico Vorgeil]] explained they had summoned them here to help them stop the ongoing [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]]. The whole world was only able to continue existing thanks to [[Shield Of Aegis\|Shield Of Aegis]] which had expanded to a giant size over the African Continent. With the promise of gold, a world on the brink of existence and begging, the Flashborn took the task of defeating [[Sol\|Sol]]. To do this, they were instructed to break into a facility in Germany, steal a rocket, use [[UMA MOVE\|UMA MOVE]] to fire that rocket into space and activate the [[New Eve Project\|New Eve Project]] and fire it into [[Sol\|Sol]]. When they broke in, they had to fight against [[Shen Xiang\|Shen Xiang]] and [[Chikara Shiogen\|Chikara Shiogen]] who were being forced to fight them by [[UMA SOUL\|UMA SOUL]]. They also briefly fought [[Tella Fren\|Tella Fren]] After that battle, they solved a puzzle to unlock the rocket sequence, entered Mars and took note of [[Xilonen Yakche\|Xilonen Yakche]], [[Mico Vorgeil\|Mico Vorgeil]]'s ex boyfriend who despite all the intelligence in the world, lacked the basic emotional insight to understand her needs. After fighting an invisible [[Sean Datz\|Sean Datz]], they broke into the core of the [[New Eve Project\|New Eve Project]] and de-stablized the anti-matter core. This alongside some clever positioning allowed them to fire it straight into the "Sun" which turned out to be an egg or container for [[Sol\|Sol]]. Before getting knocked out, it created [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/UMA\|UMA]] Fantasy and [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/UMA\|UMA]] Magic before exiling them from its world, changing the genre of [[Earth\|Earth]] to be more fantastical in nature. Before it was knocked unconsious, it also enacted [[Sol's Reformation Plan\|Sol's Reformation Plan]]. The Flashborn themselves were exhiled to their respective home-planes and branded with a mark of Sol. Giving them an age-less immortality.
