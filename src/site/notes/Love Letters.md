My dearest Thrain,

It has been too many moons since my last letter to you, though time without you feels like an eternity. The truth of the matter feels nigh unbearable: **it has been three days since I caused your death.** It feels like poison to utter those words let alone scribe them on paper but I must confront this new alien reality I find myself in. 

I keep replaying it, Thrain, the moment I reached for your hand to reassure you everything was okay, and then I heard the sickening thud of you hitting the wall. Was it a sudden, terrifying outflow of magic? Some kind of supernatural awakening within me? Or something else entirely, something beyond even my field of study? Perhaps I am a negator, destined to unravel the very fabric of existence, just as that moment unraveled mine. I don't know, Thrain. The answers are shrouded in a thick, suffocating fog, just beyond my grasp, like a mirage on the path to Sabregrove.

How could the Sinners, those monsters, do this to you? To us? If they had never assigned you to this stupid cryptology expedition, if they had let you retire one job prior, you'd be here now. You, my brilliant Thrain, who always looked to me for guidance, for a path forward but now I feel lost. Truly, irrevocably lost. The path I walked, the work I did, it was all for you, for the happiness I knew it would bring to your heart, untainted by the upbringing I've had. Now, it all feels like a cruel joke. No amount of charity can bring you back.

I've submitted a request to use up all my PTO. Our savings, the ones we earmarked for that breathtaking trip to Kathopoli, the one you always dreamed of, I think I will use them to investigate further. I should have gone on that stupid expedition, Thrain. It should have been me, ravaged by whatever monstrous entity resided within that place. Not you, my love, never you.

I can think I may be able to call upon my connections in **Stopgap**. They may be part of those dregs of society you saved me from joining but they are resourceful. If it turns out fruitful, then I may finally figure out what that force is and how I may be able to bring you back. First I should hire some clerics but I'm not sure how far I can go on a researcher's salary. I promise you this, I will bring you back. No matter what it takes. Please just hold on for me. You're all I have. 


Yours, Laika Spades.


Dear Thrain, 

My dearest Thrain,

Those connections... well, they were as useless as a whisper in a hurricane. Not a single scrap of meaningful information about what's truly going on. It seems the "dregs of society" are more interested in their own petty schemes than in helping me unravel this mystery.

So, I took matters into my own hands. I've been poring over the last hundred years of the vault's history, and it's clear now: the Orcs were indeed trying to enclose an Unidentified Mysterious Anomaly within that chamber. I even managed to carve out a small hole and peek inside. If I had to hazard a guess, it appears to be a UMA with dominion over colour itself. That terrible beast, of which I am too weak to fight, is what I hazard led to your psychosis, 

I'm almost out of PTO, and honestly, I think it's time I start looking for a new career path regardless. This research, this desperate hunt for answers, has consumed me. I know you wouldn't approve, my love, but all the roads leading to what happened that night point directly to either the Sinners or the Union. And while the Union, with their goody-two-shoes leader Ichico, might have some information, I suspect the Sinners are far more likely to know a way to bring you back.

I never liked Ichico. She's far too condescending to be a convincing representative for any organization, and let's not forget how suspiciously she acquired all those diamond-rich plots of land before even the Dornfells Kingdom had a clue about the deposits. She's no saint, despite their claims.

Regardless, I fear I might have to join the Sinners' ranks. It's the only way I can get the information I need about bringing you back. I apologize, my love, but it is essential that I act while I still can. Every moment wasted is a moment you're not by my side.

Yours even after death,

Laika Stence


Yours even after death,

My dearest Thrain,

I think I might finally have a lead on this. It happened one night when I saw a pond and an empty bench nearby. I thought of how you would wake me in those dreadful early mornings just so you could feed the ducks, and so I imagined you on that very bench. It was then, in that rare moment of which I felt the essence of peace, that the bench suddenly moved towards me. It was ripped from the ground and pulled into my hands. What a cruel mistress fate can be, to show me this now. It was my desperate desire to hold you in my arms that led to you being pulled through that wall.

The Sinners have granted me more funding than I could have ever dreamed King Irmin would give me. It took a while, but I sourced some subjects to experiment on. It turns out, whenever a person is killed by a negation, such as my affliction, it warps reality to such an extent that resurrection seems impossible on a macro level. Even the Sinner clerics, with all their forbidden knowledge, could only manage to bring back an arm to life, not the whole person.

But this, my love, this means there is still hope. It means the magic isn't completely gone. I just have to find a way to condense resurrection magic into a purer, stronger form than has ever existed before. A form potent enough to undo the very fabric of my unwitting destruction.

Until I write to you again, know that I am closer.

Laika Stence

My one true love Thrain,

I've found the way out. It happened while I was observing a subject who, miraculously, managed to survive my attack. I saw the slightest disturbance in his magic fields, a faint shimmer. It appears the body produces an essence, an elixir, to heal itself when injured. This essence, however faint, seems to have the same effect as the healing magic cast by clerics.

Considering it's such a low-level effect, I can only assume that if we condense it furtherâ€”by forcing greater sources of healing, like a leg wound versus a mere paper cut, or by combining multiple sources of healing until they mutate, we may have a chance of condensing it into something stronger than even true resurrection. Something that can overcome the negation based injuries. I've placed your body within a stasis chamber so you shall not age a single day.

In the meanwhile, the Sinners have promoted me to a Vice and given me charge over a factory to complete my research faster. Selling these basic healing essences to adventurers and the like seems to be a profitable venture for them. For me? It's the justification I need to keep my factory funded, and keep my work going.

We've found that every single body has its own unique composition of healing essence, depending on the amount and type of injuries it has sustained. An adventurer, for example, will provide a more versatile essence than a clerk, but the clerk's essence is stronger at healing specific clerical injuries like paper cuts or internal pain. I've dubbed it "Thrain Elixir" after you, my love.

Before your would-be 30th birthday, I promise I will bring you back.

Please hang on,

Laika Stence
