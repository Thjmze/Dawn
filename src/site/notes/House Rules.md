# Homebrew Rule Reference

## 1. Character Creation Rules
- Everyone gains one free feat at 1st level (cannot be traded for an ASI); the **Lucky** feat is banned.
- Variant Human/Custom Lineage  is not allowed.
- Ability scores must use **standard array** or **point-buy**.
- All class features, rolls, and stats must be on your Roll20 sheet, even if you also use D&D Beyond.
- Sessions proceed with at least four players present. 3 if I suspect it's RP heavy. 
## 2. Resource & Equipment Simplifications
- Ammunition isn’t tracked; buy more whenever you visit a shop.
- Material components are ignored—except when you need an item over 100gp to complete the spell

## 3. Spell Variants
### Phantasmal Force
- The illusion can impose a fitting **secondary condition** (e.g., water-filled diving helmet → **Deafened**).
- An illusion cannot impose two conditions at the same time (eg. Iron Maiden can only impose either a. Restrained or b. Blinded)
- The phantasm **moves with the target** even if that creature moves 15 ft.; it exists only within the victim’s mind.

## 4. Traps & Environmental Interactions
- **Trap “click”**: When a trap readies, everyone  within the trap's effective range hears a click and may take **one stationary reaction** (e.g., crouch, raise shield). The choice may raise or lower the trap’s save DC, depending on the trap. For example crouching may reduce the DC on an over-head trap but heighten the DC on a false-floor trap
- **Falling onto a creature**:
  • Target makes a Dex save.  
    – **Success**: You take normal fall damage; target shifts 5 ft. in any direction.  
    – **Failure**: Same, **plus** the target also takes **double** the fall damage you suffered.
## 5. Combat Actions & Mechanics
- **Natural 20 on Initiative**: You may place yourself anywhere in the initiative order.
- **Player Critical Hits**: Roll damage normally, then **add the maximum value of the damage dice**.  
  *Example: Longsword crit → 1d8 + STR + 8.*
- **Hidden HP & Death Saves**:  
  • HP is described narratively (“bleeding heavily”); numbers stay secret from other players.  
  • Death saves are rolled **to GM only**.  
  • *When casting a healing spell*, you may reveal HP to avoid overheal.
- **Healing Options**:  
  • **Out of combat**: all healing dice with the exception of short rest are treated as maximum.  
  • **In combat**: choose **bonus action (roll)** or **action (max)**
- **Magical Revival**: Any magical healing immediately restores consciousness if incapacitation was caused by damage (not effects like *Hypnotic Pattern*).
- If you fall onto a creature, it may make a dex save to avoid you. On a success, you take the regular amount of fall damage and it moves 5ft in any direction. On a fail, the same effect applies but the target takes double fall damage. 
- So ruling for twin spell rules + phantasmal force trick person: A. Phantasmal Force must create the same illusion if twinned UNLESS the user passes an Arcana DC20 check. B. If Phantasmal Force is used to make enemies target each other, the target is instead allowed to make an Int Save to dispel the effect instead of an investigation check. As for targeting: the phantasm can appear anywhere within the target's perception. The phantasm can move when relevant (ie no moving bridge but if you phantasm a cat then it can move inside the target's perception) 
## 6. Death & Narrative Flavor
- Whenever you roll a death save—pass **or** fail—describe a memory that flashes before your eyes.
- Not really a house rule more like an interpretation but if a flying creature is knocked prone AND has the hover condition, you still retain your full movement since crawling in the air makes no sense
## 7. Notes 
* When notes are taken, they're entered into a tally. I'll choose a number. Once that amount of notes has been taken, a rare magic item will be given or made available to the party. This will be of a higher strength as the campaign progresses.
