The lake around which Western Ten Towns has been settled. [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Easthaven\|Easthaven]], [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Caer Dineval\|Caer Dineval]], and [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Caer Konig\|Caer Konig]] are all along the lake. In warmer times, a ferry transports men and goods for a modest fee between the three towns.
