| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/11\|11]] | #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden Opting to shelter for the night in the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]], the party feasted on moose meat and drank [[Macreadus\|Macreadus]]'s wine. The surrounding mile had turned green and warm form the [[Summer Star\|Summer Star]], though a chill still blew in on the wind and snowflakes intermittently fell. Nearing midnight, [[Azgul\|Azgul]] perceived voices on the wind, like the sound of frost. [[Tetro\|Tetro]] saw no aurora in the sky and took note of a bird of prey passing the moon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/11\|11]] | #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden The bird was no storm eagle. It was a legendary [[Roc\|Roc]], and it landed on the roof of the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]] and began preening its wingspan of at least a hundred feet with its raptor beak. Soon a voice prompted the party to exit, and after an attempt to stealth away, they soon met with [[Auril\|Auril the Frostmaiden]]. She appeared as a 7 foot tall humanoid with the head of a snowy owl, black talons, cloven hooves, and great curved goat horns protruding from her head. Her cloak and cowl appeared as part wolf fur and part pristine snow. The party later heard legends that this appearance has led to her being called the *Cold Crone*.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/11\|11]] | #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden [[Auril\|Auril]] demanded to see the Summer Star, whose magic she detected when its radiant burst fired. When the party resisted, she froze [[Crank\|Crank]] and [[Oona\|Oona]] and used the time to hone her detection of the magical item. She found it, teleporting besides [[Tetro\|Tetro]] and clutching the "useless trinket." Her frost began taking it over, the magical creaking and craftsmanship coming undone. With quick thinking the party set up a diversion, [[Fern\|Fern]] using [[Jarnathan\|Jarnathan]] as bait, [[Azgul\|Azgul]] creating mirror images of himself about the Frostmaiden, and [[Tetro\|Tetro]] casting *heat metal* on the [[Summer Star\|Summer Star]] before wild-shaping into a velociraptor and dashing into the woods. The party fled [[Auril\|Auril]], who looked through the remaining [[Azgul\|Azgul]] before teleporting onto the back of her [[Roc\|Roc]] and flying away. |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/11\|11]] | #TheRimeoftheFrostmaiden #LakeMonster Re-cooperating in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Lonelywood\|Lonelywood]] from the events at the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]], the party took stock that they lost their sled dogs and that the [[Summer Star\|Summer Star]] was damaged, though perhaps not irredeemably. They decided to quest to [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bremen\|Bremen]] to take care of the supposed lake monster in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Maer Dualdon\|Maer Dualdon]] for now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/12\|12]] | #NatureSpirits [[Tali\|Tali]] introduced the party to [[Dannika Graysteel\|Dannika Graysteel]], another half-elf scholar who has been staying in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bremen\|Bremen]] for months searching for hints of [[Fauna\|Chwinga]] activity. Dannika's nose is more in her books than her legs are in the field, though. She gives the party a ***lantern of tracking*** that supposedly glows greenish-blue in the presence of the nature spirits. |

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/06\|06]] | #ABeautifulMine #TheSignal An ancient illithid skull was found well-preserved at the base of the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine\|Termalaine]] gem mine. Inside the skull was a Psi Crystal, which [[Tetro\|Tetro]] took and began pondering, attuning to it. |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/12\|12]] | #TheSignal Amidst talking about the [[Spine of the World\|Spine of the World]], a ping rang out in [[Tetro\|Tetro]]'s head. "Find us!" it said.                                                                                                    |

The inn, unfortunately, has had its roof collapse since the relentless winter began. |

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/12\|12]] | #BlackSwords Wrapping up their lodging at the local inn, [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bremen#Buried Treasures\|Buried Treasures]], they took note of the distraught and nervous innkeeper, [[Cora Mulphoon\|Cora Mulphoon]]. Cora beseeches the adventurers to bring news of her missing son, [[Huarwar Mulphoon\|Huarwar Mulphoon]]. Huarwar went missing during a blizzard while searching for the town's doddering elderly speaker, [[Dorbulgruf Shalescar\|Dorbulgruf]]. Huarwar returned days later, but was cold and distant. Cora found what looked like a shard of [[Chardalyn\| black ice]] in his room. Huarwar snatched it back and threatened her to never touch it again. The next day two tieflings with black amulets came to town and offered Huarwar sanctuary at their castle. He left with them two months ago. |

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/02\|02]] | #TheMeadMustFlow You learned that the mead from [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Good Mead\|Good Mead]] is pretty darn good, except that supplies have shrunk ever since their speaker got himself killed by... a polar bear? A yeti? A barbarian? Word of mouth sucks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/12\|12]] | #TheMeadMustFlow [[Naerth Maxildannar\|Naerth]] noted such immense grief over the loss of [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Good Mead\|Good Mead]]'s speaker. He said he was diligently working on providing a new speaker for the town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/13\|13]] | #TheMeadMustFlow [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Good Mead\|Good Mead]]'s ever dwindling supply of honey ale just didn't sit right with the party. Between the righteousness of beer and a possible [[Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] replacement for their Town Hall speaker, the party hoofed it to the town. On arrival, though small in stature, the village was literally buzzing from the ice bees in the main mead hall. Here they met [[Olivessa Untapoor\|Olivessa Untapoor]], eldest cask-maker of the town's Chultan families. Oli woefully admitted that she was indeed running for speaker, ever since [[Kendrick Rielsbarrow\|Kendrick Rielsbarrow]] had been speared to death when a verbeeg assaulted the town and stole three casks. Kendrick's corpse was laid down for mourning in the Shrine of the Flaming Sword, an aged local hall once dedicated to Tempus. |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/13\|13]] | #TheMeadMustFlow The opposition to [[Olivessa Untapoor\|Olivessa Untapoor]] was a relative newcomer to the village, a brusque red-haired dwarf and logger named [[Shandar Froth\|Shandar Froth]]. Shandar had relocated to Good Mead only a couple years back from [[Mirabar\|Mirabar]], a wealthy mining city south of the Spine of the World. The party found him near the logging lodges, and, while gruff, Shandar put his foot down that he is running because he needs to... and that the town needs a leader too, damnit. The insightful [[Tetro\|Tetro]] felt there was truth to his words, but that a bit more remained unsaid.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/13\|13]] | #TheMeadMustFlow The verbeeg was last sighted in the northern woods and a search party had gone missing. Heading to the forest, the party ran into [[Fef Morwyn\|Fef Morwyn]], a terrified scout. Fef had found the search party: the lot of them clubbed to death in a grove. Following the large footsteps at the scene, the party found a cave network, part of which was connected to indigenous ruins and crypts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/13\|13]] | #TheMeadMustFlow Stealthily moving through the cave, [[Fern\|Fern]] managed to cast *Charm Person* on the verbeeg, who was named [[Duhg\|Duhg]]. "Fern is friend, right Duhg?" "Oh yeah, totally friend." "Fern can see the casks of mead, yes?" "Oh yes. Yes. I have casks, come partake!" "Duhg, I'm the only friend here, correct?" "Only Friend is here!" As Fern followed Duhg into the cave with the party a fair distance behind, several goats bleated. "Duhg took these from a farmer. He's dead now! Ha ha!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/14\|14]] | #battle  #TheMeadMustFlow [[Fern\|Fern]] had the charmed [[Duhg\|Duhg]] lead her to the interior of the cave, where he had kept [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Good Mead\|Good Mead]]'s casks. Unfortunately, an ogre, affectionately nicknamed Friend by Duhg because the lunk never remember his own name, was asleep back there and soon became roused. This led to battle and a beast war between wild-shaped great ape [[Tetro\|Tetro]] and the cave bear Yogobor that Duhg kept as a pet. [[Hazel\|Hazel]] developed a signature attack, boosting off of [[Crank\|Crank]]'s mitts to crack the ogre dead. He dubbed it the Hazel Nutcracker.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/14\|14]] | #TheMeadMustFlow The party recovered two full casks of [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Good Mead\|Good Mead]]'s honey mead alongside an assortment of loot from Duhg's belongings. They continued to explore the cave, though they had learned that [[Duhg\|Duhg]] had a date with a female verbeeg named Gahg later in the evening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/14\|14]] | #TheMeadMustFlow The cave system hosted a burial chamber for an ancient indigenous tribal chieftain of Icewind Dale's past. Pictograms depicted the clan's journey across the [[Spine of the World\|Spine of the World]], a clash with giants, and the powers of a lightning infused weapon. Opening the sarcophagus, the party found a *Pearl of Power* and *Javelin of Lightning* in the hands of the female chieftain's skeleton. Taking the items cursed [[Azgul\|Azgul]], imposing a severe lethargy, though returning them to the skeleton recovered the condition. Eventually, [[Tetro\|Tetro]] and [[Crank\|Crank]] picked up the two items respectively and sluggishly followed the party as they explored the final chamber of the cave.                                                                     |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/14\|14]] | #TheMeadMustFlow The last chamber featured a frozen pool. Under two feet of ice was a crystalline clear spring of water, and at the bottom was a stone statue of Silvanus, god of nature. After [[Fern\|Fern]] detected abjuration magic, [[Azgul\|Azgul]] blasted through the ice, and [[Tetro\|Tetro]] shaped the waters so they could investigate, it was revealed that the pool's waters were blessed by Silvanus, providing the benefit of *Greater Restoration*. This relieved the cursed party members. [[Fern\|Fern]] filled a waterskin, hoping the water would retain its properties away from the spring.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/14\|14]] | #battle #TheMeadMustFlow At dusk the party left the caves with a rickety wagon loaded up with good mead casks. Soon, they ran into [[Duhg\|Duhg]]'s woman, the verbeeg Gahg. While they avoided her at first, she returned with a vengeance, nearly killing [[Hazel\|Hazel]] before falling in battle to [[Azgul\|Azgul]]'s witchbolt and [[Oona\|Oona]]'s axe. Gahg carried a basket of strange metal shards, seemingly scavenged as gift for her lover. The party members deduced this metal was completely foreign in nature and perhaps valuable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/14\|14]] | #TheMeadMustFlow Back in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Good Mead\|Good Mead]] with the casks in hand, the party received praise, lodging, and, of course, fresh drink from [[Olivessa Untapoor\|Olivessa Untapoor]]. The next morning the company awoke at noon to an argument between townsfolk about the election for speaker. News travels fast in small towns. With the returned casks, support had magnified to promoting the reluctant cask maker Olivessa. Gossips also noted that her opponent, the popular yet surly [[Shandar Froth\|Shandar Froth]], had left on urgent business immediately before dawn. Where did he go, and who is to become speaker?                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/02\|02]] | #ColdHeartedKiller A murder victim had been discovered on the steps of the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bryn Shander#Council Hall\|Council Hall]]. The victim was a commoner, who had no business in the area. It seems someone is sending a message.

At the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos#Luskan Arms\|Luskan Arms]], the depressed innkeeper [[Owenn Tarsenal\|Owenn Tarsenal]] discussed the lottery with them and, after remembering that this party were the ones who delivered the stolen armory goods, that Speaker [[Naerth Maxildannar\|Naerth]] may be worth speaking with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

They tie up the lottery winners outside the walls for the cold to spirit away during the night. The last lottery winner ran away, though, and was found hewn nearly in half in the snowfields. This most recent winner also ran, but was caught by mercenaries working for [[Torg\|Torg]]'s merchant company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/12\|12]] | #ColdHeartedKiller The party met [[Naerth Maxildannar\|Naerth Maxildannar]] in his lodging on the second floor of the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos#Luskan Arms\|Luskan Arms]]. Captain [[Skath\|Skath]] stood guard and was about to turn the party away, but Naerth, who was feeding his pet flying snakes, heard [[Crank\|Crank]] outside and let them in. Naerth was so pleased to see "his boy" Crank, though, perhaps, the feeling wasn't mutual. Naerth extolled the virtues of the current lottery, the strength and importance of [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]], and the dire straits that he believes [[Dalefolk\|Ten Towns]] is in with the current winter. He so warmly offered his services to the party. He and Skath were off to meet [[Torg\|Torg]] over the lottery escapee, and the party decided to accompany them.                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/12\|12]] | #ColdHeartedKiller Following [[Naerth Maxildannar\|Naerth]] to [[Torg\|Torg]]'s [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]] warehouse, the adventurers saw the teenage girl fugitive. While Torg was negotiating with Naerth, a mercenary in his hire, [[Sephek Kaltro\|Sephek Kaltro]], demanded that the girl meet her immediate end for her crimes. This escalated quickly, culminating in Sephek's execution of the girl and Naerth's digust with Torg's enterprise. Torg, in a rage and panic, told his crew to clean up this mess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/12\|12]] | #ColdHeartedKiller In [[Torg\|Torg]]'s [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]] warehouse, the adventurers were able to discern that [[Sephek Kaltro\|Sephek]] was a recent hire of Torg's. He was a former sailor from [[Luskan\|Luskan]] who served on the [[Dark Duchess\|Dark Duchess]]. Sephek seemed to be a [[Midwinter Child\|Midwinter Child]] from his lack of warm attire. He had ice blue eyes. [[Tetro\|Tetro]] and [[Hazel\|Hazel]] offered [[Torg\|Torg]] assistance in removing and burying the nameless body and left the scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/12\|12]] | #battle #ColdHeartedKiller [[Torg\|Torg]]'s warehouse thinned out later in the evening. When asked about his time on the ship,  [[Sephek Kaltro\|Sephek]] attested that those days were in his past life. When asked about the girl, Sephek praised the winter goddess, and spoke of his valiance in honoring her quarry. Battle ensued, and Sephek's true nature was exposed, as he dueled with sword and dagger of ice. He tested the strengths of [[Crank\|Crank]], [[Oona\|Oona]], [[Azgul\|Azgul]], and [[Fern\|Fern]], but was hopelessly outmatched when [[Hazel\|Hazel]] and [[Tetro\|Tetro]] arrived as reinforcements. Moments before his total demise, Sephek called for [[Auril\|Auril]] to witness him. Sephek slit his throat and his curdling scream began to intertwine into of a woman. In the cold [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]] night, [[Azgul\|Azgul]] picked up Sephek's now inert longsword, noting its etched runes: Isolation, Cruelty, Endurance, and Preservation. |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/13\|13]] | #ColdHeartedKiller Passing through [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bryn Shander\|Bryn Shander]], [[Fern\|Fern]] kept her hood up, perceiving a wanted poster describing a duo of tiefling and bugbear dog thieves. Seeking [[Hlin Trollbane\|Hlin Trollbane]], the bounty huntress who hired them weeks prior to find the killer, the party, less Fern, went to Town Hall. Here [[Markham Southwell\|Sheriff Southwell]] greeted them. Trollbane had given the sheriff the bounty to dole out to the adventurers... which he would have granted if [[Hazel\|Hazel]] didn't let slip that she was friend with the dog thieves. Deception failed, the two parties agreed to let the payment slide and call it all water under the bridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

They convinced Tali, who is a researcher of the local fauna, to join them and for Berylbore to give up his two rowboat for the journey. |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/11\|11]] | #LakeMonster After some hours navigating the ice floes on [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Maer Dualdon\|Maer Dualdon]] and fishing - [[Tetro\|Tetro]] caught a spotted eel and [[Hazel\|Hazel]] caught a 40 lb knucklehead! - the party encountered a plesiosaurus, the lake monster.

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/05\|05]] | #TheGoldenDawn "The view from the mountaintop would have been crisp if the cloudcover hadn't taken hold," said [[Garret Velryn\|Garret]]. He spoke a moment too soon, as a blinding light of gold burst from the forests to the west, ripped clouds and fog asunder. The blast echoed off Kelvin's Cain, shifting the snows below, and leaving a wide hole in the midnight sky. The party felt or perhaps imagined, a brief vision of Spring, as the crackle of magic pulsed through the air. Unshielding their eyes, the stillness of the night sky lit up by the Rime immediately removed all sense of heat, frost creeping into their marrow. In the distance, riding the aurora, was a great beast... perhaps the Frostmaiden herself.                                                                                                                        |

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/10\|10]] | #TheGoldenDawn The party mulled over their leads at the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Lonelywood#Lucky Liar\| Lucky Liar]]. From atop [[Kelvin's Cairn\|Kelvin's Cairn]], they had seen a burst of golden, warm light coming from the forests of [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Lonelywood\|Lonelywood]]. Nobody seemed to live out there. [[Perilou\|Perilou]] knew of a gnome named [[Copper\|Copper]] who lived in the temple at [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bryn Shander\|Bryn Shander]], though, and this Copper spoke of a former friend, a sage of sorts, who took to hermitage in the outskirts of Lonelywood. One ole crone hinted that the sage may live in a [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]], a haunted place overlooking the forests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/10\|10]] | #TheGoldenDawn Overhearing the conversation, ever-knowing tavernkeep of the Lucky Liar, [[Danae Xotal\|Danae Xotal]], said she knew of the sage who lived out there... and hinted that the old fool was probably dead out there anyway. The sage had used Arcane Brotherhood networks to get a #SpecialDelivery several weeks ago. Intimidated by [[Azgul\|Azgul]], Danae relented and gave the party guidance to follow the ridge around [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Maer Dualdon\|Maer Dualdon]] to its western reaches, where the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]] loomed over the forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/10\|10]] | #TheGoldenDawn The [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]] was a dilapidated, abandoned structure on 20 foot stilts, creaking and groaning in the wind. A soft, thick snow had blanketed the area, removing all sight of tracks, but some lush vegetation and greenery appeared to be present in a close radius to the cabin. [[Tetro\|Tetro]] and [[Fern\|Fern]] assessed the integrity of the building, finding some weak stairs and flooring, so [[Fern\|Fern]] shattered a window and [[Hazel\|Hazel]] led the way, light-footed, to secure a rope and passage to the interior for [[Crank\|Crank]]. In the meantime, [[Oona\|Oona]] and [[Tetro\|Tetro]] looked through what seemed to be a workshop with *smith and tinkerer's tools*. [[Oona\|Oona]] entered the main area by hacking through a wall.                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/10\|10]] | #TheGoldenDawn In the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]]'s main room all the furniture was blackened with ash. There were broken wine bottles, a charred book, a burnt skeleton of a human male, and a six inch diameter device: two concentric rings with a black stone inside. While [[Azgul\|Azgul]] used magic to look over some of the ancient Giant runes, [[Tetro\|Tetro]] picked up the device. He gazed into it as it illuminated. Looking steadfastly into the light, a radiant burst enveloped the party. All that left of poor [[Tetro\|Tetro]] afterwards was turtle dust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/10\|10]] | #TheGoldenDawn The party, stunned by [[Tetro\|Tetro]]'s demise, resolved to uncover the mysteries of the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]]. [[Oona\|Oona]] swept some turtle ash into a leather pouch as a remembrance. The party discovered blueprints of what is called a *[[Summer Star\|Summer Star]]*, a reproduction of an ancient [[Netherese\|Netherese]] device to control the weather. The blueprints and runic scrawlings seemed to be the work of a madman obsessed with the Summer Star. They found a scroll sent to the sage by [[Copper\|Copper]]. The scroll confirmed the man to be [[Macreadus\|Macreadus]], detailing his maddening obsession as well as Copper's opinion that the device required *three* of something for stability, not *two*.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/10\|10]] | #TheGoldenDawn As the party pieced together clues in the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]], strange occurrences occurred. Loud knocks, three in a row, would bang as characters interacted with the items of the house. Rugs and curtains would shift, tools would fall off tables, and Copper's letter, in the hands of [[Crank\|Crank]] began to tug him in different directions, like a dowsing rod. A bottle of wine [[Fern\|Fern]] found was nearly tugged from her grasp. [[Oona\|Oona]] was fed up with this nonsense and smashed her axe into the cabin in a rage. Eventually, the party uncovered that they needed to forge a third ring, etch it with the appropriate runes, and reconstruct the *[[Summer Star\|Summer Star]]*. With [[Crank\|Crank]] smelting a new ring and [[Fern\|Fern]] forging the runes under [[Azgul\|Azgul]]'s guidance, they pieced it together.                                                   |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/10\|10]] | #TheGoldenDawn [[Hazel\|Hazel]] picked up the [[*Summer Star*\|*Summer Star*]] and attuned to the orb, as the same radiance began to fill the room. Some party members ran for cover. But the light's warmth healed their wounds, a vision of gold filled their hearts, and they felt an extra-planar voice admit, "Well Done." [[Tetro\|Tetro]] stood blinking and alive in the middle of the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]], and for a brief moment, the spirit of [[Macreadus\|Macreadus]] could be seen laughing in celebration of the *[[Summer Star\|Summer Star]]*'s successful construction. The party received a *Blessing of the Morninglord*, 10 temporary hit points at dawn from [[Compendium/Lore/Deities/Lathander\|Lathander]]. Outside, for a clear mile by sight, the winter had vanished and the hills had a verdant green, yet a chill wind seemed to follow the warm breezes. On the wind, sibilant whispers were heard, like the crackle of frost. |

Iriskree mentioned that her last lover, dead now and having bequeathed her a nice sum, was hell bent on hunting the white moose, saying that he could speak to animals and that listening to the forest would guide his path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/07\|07]] | #battle #TheWhiteMoose Three banshees, spectral female elves, surprised the party in the thick of the misty woods. The less-than-corporeal banshee resisted the party's physical onslaught. [[Old Huntsman Clive\|Old Huntsman Clive]] fell first, a banshee's phantasmal grasp bringing blood to pool in his mouth. After repeatedly being afflicted by the banshees' wails, [[Fern\|Fern]] collapsed and [[Oona\|Oona]] all but fell, relying on her orcish ancestry to keep her afoot. The party was able to thwart them in the long run, dragging their battered selves further into the wood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/07\|07]] | #TheWhiteMoose [[Chwinga\|Chwinga]] appeared by the dozen and began playing around the party's sled, playfully pelting [[Azgul\|Azgul]] with snowballs while [[Crank\|Crank]] and [[Hazel\|Hazel]] watched over the recuperating party. The chwinga tugged at the party's cloaks and led them to a clearing. Time seemed to ebb a bit differently for the next couple hours. Almost as quickly as the clearing came into focus, the chwinga disappeared. The party had arrived at Elvish ruins. A row of six statues faced a 10 ft berm, over which a massive crystalline gnomon sat in a wide circular depression. They had came across a massive moon dial. Upon further scouting, they noted a sarcaphogus flanked by blue heiroglyphic pillars, a marble gazebo on the other end of the berm, and a hole broken into the nearby cliffside, tunneling into darkness.                                                                      |

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/08\|08]] | #TheWhiteMoose A puzzle at the [[Elven Tomb\|Elven Tomb]] involving a brazier, magical glyphs, and a sealed sarcophagus was solved - with minimal injury to [[Fern\|Fern]]'s scorched hand. A mummified priestess of Selune, goddess of the moon, arose from the granite and marble crypt.  The mummy did not appear hostile and spoke ancient Elvish, but [[Tetro\|Tetro]] managed to communicate with her using telepathy granted by the psi crystal. Her name was [[Sahnar\|Sahnar]], and she is a guardian entity of the shrine. Her decayed form lacks much memory and cognition, but she seemed amenable to following the party's commands. Sahnar noted that the site has been descrated, but she sensed not why. [[Sahnar\|Sahnar]] was wearing an ornate cloak in pristine condition, a magical contrast to her otherwise decayed wrappings.                                                                                                   |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/08\|08]] | #TheWhiteMoose The moon dial's gnomon was illuminated by the full moon and was refracting a moonbeam onto a full moon glyph, which was actively glowing. Out of the other glyphs on the dial, the two half moons displayed elvish script on them. [[Tetro\|Tetro]] deduced that his moonbeam spell could activate these glyphs, and the party later found that the illuminated moon glyphs unsealed chambers inside the elven tomb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/08\|08]] | #TheWhiteMoose The half moon chambers of the [[Elven Tomb\|Elven Tomb]] contained sarcophagi. In the southern room, the sarcophagus was opened and disheveled. In the north room, [[Crank\|Crank]] saw a drying rack of herbs, druidic implements, and a nude, intact body of a recently dead woman lying atop the sarcophogus. A berry bush in the corner of the room seemed to move as well, but before Crank could react, [[Ravisin\|Ravisin]], a frost druid who was skulking in this room could no longer stay hidden.

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/08\|08]] | #TheWhiteMoose  [[Old Huntsman Clive\|Old Huntsman Clive]] called out to his granddaughter, but [[Ravisin\|Ravisin]] responded only in derision. Clive gasped at the body of [[Vurnis\|Vurnis]], who had long gone missing and was presumed dead. Ravisin blamed the Ten Towners for Vurnis's death, cursing the moral failings of humankind and seething about the need to return the world to nature. Worshiping [[Auril\|Auril]] breathed new life into her, Ravisin said, and it was Vurnis who showed her this faith. Vurnis, who was abused by the men of Ten Towns, was more alive in her death than the party could imagine, Ravisin raved. When the party asked about the moose, [[Ravisin\|Ravisin]] jeered at them. The so-called moose, she said, was doing a splendid job ridding the Dale of the blight of its human occupants.                                                                                                                       |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/08\|08]] | #battle #TheWhiteMoose [[Ravisin\|Ravisin]] conjured a dozen wolves to attack the party. The party managed to fend for themselves while they broke the frost druid's concentration, dispelling the wolves. Ravisin wild shaped into an owl and attempted to flee, but was caught by ranged attacks and came crashing into the moon dial. Calling out to her dead sister [[Vurnis\|Vurnis]] and beseeching [[Auril\|Auril]] to witness her, she cast a maelstrom of ice onto the party and herself, ending her own life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/09\|09]] | #TheWhiteMoose A dying [[Ravisin\|Ravisin]] seemed pleased with her fate. She explained her malcontent with the Dalefolk for the mistreatment of her sister [[Vurnis\|Vurnis]], which [[Old Huntsman Clive\|Old Huntsman Clive]] later expressed was most likely her rape. [[Vurnis\|Vurnis]] was a [[Midwinter Child\|Midwinter Child]], a blessed girl and the fairer of the two sisters. She had left [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Lonelywood\|Lonelywood]] months ago to seek her destiny only to meet mistreatment. She turned to the cult of [[Auril\|Auril]], becoming a frost druid. Ravisin in her youth was the less fortunate of the sisters: lesser in wits, achievement, and charms. She followed Vurnis everywhere, and thus followed her sister into a radicalized worship of the Frostmaiden.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/09\|09]] | #TheWhiteMoose [[Vurnis\|Vurnis]]'s body laid peacefully atop a closed [[Elven Tomb\|Elven Tomb]] sarcophagus, surrounded by four druidic rune stones and clutching a crystal of raw ice. On investigation, [[Fern\|Fern]] noticed Vurnis's throat had been cut and deduced it to be the cause of death, seeing no other markings. The wound must have occurred within the past two moons. While there were ligature marks along the bottom of the body, there was no frost nor evidence of the cold affecting her vitreous humors. Looking at the runes, [[Hazel\|Hazel]] recognized them from markings on local shrines of offering she had passed by in Ten Towns. [[Azgul\|Azgul]] recalled from his studies that the runes stood for [[Auril\|Auril]]'s four tenets: *Isolation, Cruelty, Endurance, and Preservation.*                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/09\|09]] | #TheWhiteMoose The northern half moon tomb also contained a rack of drying herbs and charcoal the druid had been utilizing, from which [[Fern\|Fern]] took enough samples to use for a future Find Familiar summoning. There was also an **awakened shrub** that the party named [[Joey the Shrub\|Joey the Shrub]]. It was terrified, both of [[Ravisin\|Ravisin]] and of being sentient, and it had some tasty berries. The shrub told of how Ravisin had traveled around the lakes and forest of Ten Towns awakening animals to do her bidding. The white moose is one of these creatures, though it eventually took a far more frightening form. Ravisin blamed the powers of the [[Elven Tomb\|Elven Tomb]] or the elvish banshees of the forest for this. [[Tetro\|Tetro]] tried to convince Shrub Joey to climb on his back, but the shrub was too overwhelmed to accept.                                                                                 |

Some time later, [[Joey the Shrub\|Joey the Shrub]] was planted near them to stay in the light of the forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

After a short rest, [[Azgul\|Azgul]] realized the wondrous object was a **Horn of Silent Alarm**, though he refrained from using it yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The party wrecked the distorted moose, which shriveled to its former form. |

Each party member earned **13 gold** for their efforts in the end, as well as a sled full of moose flesh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/04\|04]] | #ABeautifulMine Miners had been returning back from work in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine\|Termalaine]]. A boy on a soapbox was announcing that a monster infestation in a gem mine, and that the town speaker, a half-orc named [[Oarus Masthew\|Oarus Masthew]], had posted a 50g reward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/04\|04]] | #ABeautifulMine Speaker [[Oarus Masthew\|Oarus Masthew]] is a gregarious, seemingly liked half-orc. He detailed the troubles with the tourmaline mine. Since the mines eventually connect to the [[Underdark\|Underdark]], occasionally some denizens of the deep creep on upwards. Currently, a population of kobold seem to have taken root in the mine. There have been hosilities, but no deaths. The reward for clearing the mine is 50g, and he'd turn a blind eye to any gems the party picks up while in the mine itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/06\|06]] | #ABeautifulMine Talking to speaker [[Oarus Masthew\|Oarus Masthew]], the party agreed on a 60g reward (fair splittings!) to tackle the mine problem. The [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine\|Termalaine]] mine descended deep into the Dale and glittered with gemdust. The place was filled with kobold tracks and signs of struggle were seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/06\|06]] | #battle #ABeautifulMine Several encounters unfolded in the gem mines, mostly against easily dispatched kobolds, but also against a set of grells that had preyed on weaker beings and caused significant tension in the mine. The party eventually encountered a well-spoken kobold leader with fake dragon wings named [[T-Rex\|T-Rex]], who was found out to have been possessed by the [[Ghost of Janth\|Ghost of Janth]], a sage who had succumbed to exposure on the iceplains. The kobolds had been seeking refuge and a better life, though through a lot of skullduggery. The ghost wished to infiltrate society and, while rational, had less-than-good aspirations. The ghost was exorcised. The party, tired of shenanigans, told T-Rex and two surviving kobolds to take a hike. |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/06\|06]] | #ABeautifulMine #TheSignal An ancient illithid skull was found well-preserved at the base of the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine\|Termalaine]] gem mine. Inside the skull was a Psi Crystal, which [[Tetro\|Tetro]] took and began pondering, attuning to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/06\|06]] | #ABeautifulMine At the very base of the mine was a large vein of tourmaline! The aprty set to work with pickaxes, raking in 480 gp total worth of gems, which they later traded in town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/04\|04]] | #MountainClimb A dog, [[Boy\|Boy]], got the attention of the party and dragged them to the house of [[Keegan Velryn\|Keegan Velryn]], a schrimshander and former mountaineer. His husband [[Garret Velryn\|Garret]] was a mountain guide and had led a small expedition to [[Kelvin's Cairn\|Kelvin's Cairn]]. Boy never leaves his master's side unless there is trouble. At Keegan's request (and a promise of free rooms at the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos#Luskan Arms\|Luskan Arms]] through his friend [[Owenn Tarsenal\|Owenn Tarsenal]]), the party decided they would go on a rescue mission for Garret and company, traveling up through [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine\|Termalaine]].                                                                                                                          |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/04\|04]] | #MountainClimb Arriving at [[Kelvin's Cairn\|Kelvin's Cairn]] the next morning, the party found [[Garret Velryn\|Garret Velryn]]'s dog sled and hungry dogs.

He had lured a violent yeti away from the group of four he was guiding.

| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/05\|05]] | #MountainClimb Having rescued [[Garret Velryn\|Garret Velryn]] the party continued up [[Kelvin's Cairn\|Kelvin's Cairn]] seeking the remaining three members of the climbing expedition: a male goliath named [[Mokingo Growling Bear\|Mokingo Growling Bear]] who was in search of the legendary Winter Walker [[Characters/Misc/Oyaminartok\|Characters/Misc/Oyaminartok]], a female halfling acolyte named [[Perilou\|Perilou]], and a brooding, reticent female Tiefling named [[Astrix\|Astrix]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/05\|05]] | #MountainClimb Approaching a yeti den, the party sought the adult male yeti that attacked [[Garret Velryn\|Garret Velryn]] and company. Finding blood and several large but muddled footprints, they snuck into a cave, where they found the eviscerated torso of [[Mokingo Growling Bear\|Mokingo Growling Bear]] in a crude trophy room. Two other severed heads could be well-discerned, one belonging to [[Oobok\|Oobok]] and the other belonging to an unknown red-haired shield dwarf.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/05\|05]] | #battle #MountainClimb In the darkness, they found a yeti and two smaller indistinct forms. The party took the opportunity to attack the beast and lure it out.

It was a common destination for climbers, and in its fallen walls the party found the frozen body of [[Astrix\|Astrix]] hunched and forlorn. She had been gazing at a frozen, headless and red-haired dwarven corpse - the poor bastard whose head they had seen in the trophy room. [[Astrix\|Astrix]] had a Potion of Invisibility and a leather-bound spellbook in her posession.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
