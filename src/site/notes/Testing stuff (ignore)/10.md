## The Black Cabin
- (x:: #ArcaneBrotherhood The party spent the morning in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Lonelywood\|Lonelywood]], picking up rumors and reading the [[Ten Towns Times\|Ten Towns Times]]. They wondered whether to pick up some coin in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bremen\|Bremen]], where sighting of a lake monster in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Maer Dualdon\|Maer Dualdon]] had scared off fishermen. They also considered the tale of missing sailors near the eastern [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Lac Dinneshere\|Lac Dinneshere]], and recalled that [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Easthaven\|Easthaven]] is where [[Vellynne Harpell\|Vellynne Harpell]] had set off to capitalize on [[Dzaan\|Dzaan]]'s misfortune. There was still a killer on the loose, too. Ultimately, the party decided to chase down the golden burst of light they had seen from atop [[Kelvin's Cairn\|Kelvin's Cairn]] several days ago.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn The party mulled over their leads at the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Lonelywood#Lucky Liar\| Lucky Liar]]. From atop [[Kelvin's Cairn\|Kelvin's Cairn]], they had seen a burst of golden, warm light coming from the forests of [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Lonelywood\|Lonelywood]]. Nobody seemed to live out there. [[Perilou\|Perilou]] knew of a gnome named [[Copper\|Copper]] who lived in the temple at [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bryn Shander\|Bryn Shander]], though, and this Copper spoke of a former friend, a sage of sorts, who took to hermitage in the outskirts of Lonelywood. One ole crone hinted that the sage may live in a [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]], a haunted place overlooking the forests.) 
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn Overhearing the conversation, ever-knowing tavernkeep of the Lucky Liar, [[Danae Xotal\|Danae Xotal]], said she knew of the sage who lived out there... and hinted that the old fool was probably dead out there anyway. The sage had used Arcane Brotherhood networks to get a #SpecialDelivery several weeks ago. Intimidated by [[Azgul\|Azgul]], Danae relented and gave the party guidance to follow the ridge around [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Maer Dualdon\|Maer Dualdon]] to its western reaches, where the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]] loomed over the forest.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn The [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]] was a dilapidated, abandoned structure on 20 foot stilts, creaking and groaning in the wind. A soft, thick snow had blanketed the area, removing all sight of tracks, but some lush vegetation and greenery appeared to be present in a close radius to the cabin. [[Tetro\|Tetro]] and [[Fern\|Fern]] assessed the integrity of the building, finding some weak stairs and flooring, so [[Fern\|Fern]] shattered a window and [[Hazel\|Hazel]] led the way, light-footed, to secure a rope and passage to the interior for [[Crank\|Crank]]. In the meantime, [[Oona\|Oona]] and [[Tetro\|Tetro]] looked through what seemed to be a workshop with *smith and tinkerer's tools*. [[Oona\|Oona]] entered the main area by hacking through a wall.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn In the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]]'s main room all the furniture was blackened with ash. There were broken wine bottles, a charred book, a burnt skeleton of a human male, and a six inch diameter device: two concentric rings with a black stone inside. While [[Azgul\|Azgul]] used magic to look over some of the ancient Giant runes, [[Tetro\|Tetro]] picked up the device. He gazed into it as it illuminated. Looking steadfastly into the light, a radiant burst enveloped the party. All that left of poor [[Tetro\|Tetro]] afterwards was turtle dust.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn The party, stunned by [[Tetro\|Tetro]]'s demise, resolved to uncover the mysteries of the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]]. [[Oona\|Oona]] swept some turtle ash into a leather pouch as a remembrance. The party discovered blueprints of what is called a *[[Summer Star\|Summer Star]]*, a reproduction of an ancient [[Netherese\|Netherese]] device to control the weather. The blueprints and runic scrawlings seemed to be the work of a madman obsessed with the Summer Star. They found a scroll sent to the sage by [[Copper\|Copper]]. The scroll confirmed the man to be [[Macreadus\|Macreadus]], detailing his maddening obsession as well as Copper's opinion that the device required *three* of something for stability, not *two*.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn As the party pieced together clues in the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]], strange occurrences occurred. Loud knocks, three in a row, would bang as characters interacted with the items of the house. Rugs and curtains would shift, tools would fall off tables, and Copper's letter, in the hands of [[Crank\|Crank]] began to tug him in different directions, like a dowsing rod. A bottle of wine [[Fern\|Fern]] found was nearly tugged from her grasp. [[Oona\|Oona]] was fed up with this nonsense and smashed her axe into the cabin in a rage. Eventually, the party uncovered that they needed to forge a third ring, etch it with the appropriate runes, and reconstruct the *[[Summer Star\|Summer Star]]*. With [[Crank\|Crank]] smelting a new ring and [[Fern\|Fern]] forging the runes under [[Azgul\|Azgul]]'s guidance, they pieced it together.)
- (x:: #TheGoldenDawn [[Hazel\|Hazel]] picked up the [[*Summer Star*\|*Summer Star*]] and attuned to the orb, as the same radiance began to fill the room. Some party members ran for cover. But the light's warmth healed their wounds, a vision of gold filled their hearts, and they felt an extra-planar voice admit, "Well Done." [[Tetro\|Tetro]] stood blinking and alive in the middle of the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]], and for a brief moment, the spirit of [[Macreadus\|Macreadus]] could be seen laughing in celebration of the *[[Summer Star\|Summer Star]]*'s successful construction. The party received a *Blessing of the Morninglord*, 10 temporary hit points at dawn from [[Compendium/Lore/Deities/Lathander\|Lathander]]. Outside, for a clear mile by sight, the winter had vanished and the hills had a verdant green, yet a chill wind seemed to follow the warm breezes. On the wind, sibilant whispers were heard, like the crackle of frost.)
