> **Targos. Termalaine. And Kelvin's Tortuous Terrain.**
##  To Targos. 
- (x:: #ArmoredCorps Knocking on the rear entrance of [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bryn Shander#The Hooked Knucklehead\|The Hooked Knucklehead]] caught the half-orc and Zhentarim ruffian [[Zarruk\|Zarruk]] off-guard. Surrounded by the six party members, he fessed up that some stolen crates of shortsword, daggers, and light crossbows from [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bryn Shander#Armory\|Bryn Shander Armory]] were still in his custody and due to head to [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]]. The party wanted in on their transport. Intimidated by [[Fern\|Fern]] and company and tithout another option, Zarruk complied, telling them to drop it off at [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos#Luskan Arms\| The Luskan Arms]] for the usual remunerations.)
- (x:: #ArmoredCorps Half the stolen goods were restored to [[Markham Southwell\|Markham Southwell]]'s control. [[Hazel\|Hazel]] managed to persuide the sheriff to let them take the other half to the Zhentarim in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]] and act as double agents.)
- (x:: [[Azgul\|Azgul]] acquired scale mail from [[Markham Southwell\|Markham Southwell]] for 50gp, trading in his chain shirt for 5gp as well.)
- (x:: Six sled dogs and a sled were rented for 20gp for the day's run to [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]]. It is unclear if this rental will be honored. With the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bryn Shander#Stables\|stable]] keeper in a hurry, [[Crank\|Crank]] noted they never left a deposit, after all.)
- (x:: Traveling between [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bryn Shander\|Bryn Shander]] towards [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]], the party passed an ecstatic wailing woman, not dressed for winter on the side of the trail. With a fire cooking some form of meat.)
- (x:: #ArmoredCorps The party dropped off the crate for Zhentarim pickup in the shed at the rear of the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos#Luskan Arms\|Luskan Arms]]. The tavernkeeper, [[Owenn Tarsenal\|Owenn Tarsenal]], seems to turn a blind eye to these dealings. He paid the usual sum he is instructed to give, 60sp, alongside an evening's swill and meal, some fish sausage.)
- (x:: [[Azgul\|Azgul]] spoke with [[Owenn Tarsenal\|Owenn Tarsenal]] about happenings in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]]. The town conducts a [[Dalefolk\|blood sacrifice]] lottery on the new moon. The town speaker, [[Naerth Maxildannar\|Naerth Maxildannar]], and his council run it, and the militia captain [[Skath\|Skath]] officiates the sacrifice to appease the goddess of winter's wrath. The lottery is conducted during the three days prior to the new moon with the militia controlling passage into the town during those days.)
- (x:: #ColdHeartedKiller The murder in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]] appeared to be a man who fled the results of the lottery.)
- (x:: #MountainClimb A dog, [[Boy\|Boy]], got the attention of the party and dragged them to the house of [[Keegan Velryn\|Keegan Velryn]], a schrimshander and former mountaineer. His husband [[Garret Velryn\|Garret]] was a mountain guide and had led a small expedition to [[Kelvin's Cairn\|Kelvin's Cairn]]. Boy never leaves his master's side unless there is trouble. At Keegan's request (and a promise of free rooms at the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos#Luskan Arms\|Luskan Arms]] through his friend [[Owenn Tarsenal\|Owenn Tarsenal]]), the party decided they would go on a rescue mission for Garret and company, traveling up through [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine\|Termalaine]].)

## To Termalaine. 
- (x:: Arriving at the dark of early evening, the party found lodging at [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine#The Eastlook\|The Eastlook]]. The innkeeper, a teenage girl named [[Marta Pekryk\|Marta Pekryk]], who tends to the inn ever since her father took ill, had been softly singing the following verse: *Ahead of winter’s wind she came / The lovely woman with no name; / Draped in a fur-lined cloak of red / To the icy lake she fled; / The wind pursued her all the same / As sure as night she’s dead.* This song was a legend about a forlorn traveler who gifted a ring of warmth to her grandparents. The traveler died the next day when she departed. Marta wears the ring, and it seems to bring her comfort. ![[rotf_94_ring_of_warmth.png\| 250]])
- (x:: #ABeautifulMine Miners had been returning back from work in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine\|Termalaine]]. A boy on a soapbox was announcing that a monster infestation in a gem mine, and that the town speaker, a half-orc named [[Oarus Masthew\|Oarus Masthew]], had posted a 50g reward. )
- (x:: The party visited [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine#The Blue Clam\|The Blue Clam]], the harborside tavern. It was filled with fishers and miners. Some dwarf were spicing their chowder with lead, a sweet tooth garnish for the poison resilient dwarves. The tavern owner and chef, a half-orc named [[Vernon Braig\|Vernon Braig]], served the party, noting that the stew tonight had rabbit brought from [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Lonelywood\|Lonelywood]] trappers.)
- (x:: #ABeautifulMine Speaker [[Oarus Masthew\|Oarus Masthew]] is a gregarious, seemingly liked half-orc. He detailed the troubles with the tourmaline mine. Since the mines eventually connect to the [[Underdark\|Underdark]], occasionally some denizens of the deep creep on upwards. Currently, a population of kobold seem to have taken root in the mine. There have been hosilities, but no deaths. The reward for clearing the mine is 50g, and he'd turn a blind eye to any gems the party picks up while in the mine itself.)

## A Rescue at Kelvin's Cairn
- (x:: #MountainClimb Arriving at [[Kelvin's Cairn\|Kelvin's Cairn]] the next morning, the party found [[Garret Velryn\|Garret Velryn]]'s dog sled and hungry dogs. Having fed them, they traveresed the icy cliffside, saw mountain goat, and eventually found Garret, knocked unconscious after a fall. He had lured a violent yeti away from the group of four he was guiding. Garret is a scout by training, and while exhausted and wounded, is still able-bodied.)
- (x:: #battle #MountainClimb Three crag cats pounced on the party. [[Garret Velryn\|Garret]] fought alongside them. These were big, mean kitties.)
