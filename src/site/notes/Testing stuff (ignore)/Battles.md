| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/14\|14]] | #battle  #TheMeadMustFlow [[Fern\|Fern]] had the charmed [[Duhg\|Duhg]] lead her to the interior of the cave, where he had kept [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Good Mead\|Good Mead]]'s casks. Unfortunately, an ogre, affectionately nicknamed Friend by Duhg because the lunk never remember his own name, was asleep back there and soon became roused. This led to battle and a beast war between wild-shaped great ape [[Tetro\|Tetro]] and the cave bear Yogobor that Duhg kept as a pet. [[Hazel\|Hazel]] developed a signature attack, boosting off of [[Crank\|Crank]]'s mitts to crack the ogre dead. He dubbed it the Hazel Nutcracker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/14\|14]] | #battle #TheMeadMustFlow At dusk the party left the caves with a rickety wagon loaded up with good mead casks. Soon, they ran into [[Duhg\|Duhg]]'s woman, the verbeeg Gahg. While they avoided her at first, she returned with a vengeance, nearly killing [[Hazel\|Hazel]] before falling in battle to [[Azgul\|Azgul]]'s witchbolt and [[Oona\|Oona]]'s axe. Gahg carried a basket of strange metal shards, seemingly scavenged as gift for her lover. The party members deduced this metal was completely foreign in nature and perhaps valuable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/12\|12]] | #battle #ColdHeartedKiller [[Torg\|Torg]]'s warehouse thinned out later in the evening. When asked about his time on the ship,  [[Sephek Kaltro\|Sephek]] attested that those days were in his past life. When asked about the girl, Sephek praised the winter goddess, and spoke of his valiance in honoring her quarry. Battle ensued, and Sephek's true nature was exposed, as he dueled with sword and dagger of ice. He tested the strengths of [[Crank\|Crank]], [[Oona\|Oona]], [[Azgul\|Azgul]], and [[Fern\|Fern]], but was hopelessly outmatched when [[Hazel\|Hazel]] and [[Tetro\|Tetro]] arrived as reinforcements. Moments before his total demise, Sephek called for [[Auril\|Auril]] to witness him. Sephek slit his throat and his curdling scream began to intertwine into of a woman. In the cold [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]] night, [[Azgul\|Azgul]] picked up Sephek's now inert longsword, noting its etched runes: Isolation, Cruelty, Endurance, and Preservation.  |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/11\|11]] | #battle After fleeing [[Auril\|Auril]] at the [[Black Cabin\|Black Cabin]], the party fought against a full strength Coldlight Walker and an initially camouflaged Ice Mephit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/11\|11]] | #battle #LakeMonster The party fought the plesiosaurus from their rowboats as well as from nearby ice floes after [[Crank\|Crank]] netted it. They were surprised when the beast spoke! It had been awakened by [[Ravisin\|Ravisin]] to terrorize Ten Towns and convinced by her that if it failed to kill in reverence of the [[Auril\|the Frostmaiden]], then she would revoke its new-found intelligence. The party, with mixed-feelings, decided it was best to neutralize the murderous beast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/09\|09]] | #battle #TheWhiteMoose A thick fog began to blanket the area, and sounds of a moose were heard in the distance. The party bunkered in the tomb for a quick rest, but then heard the *pwah!* noise of [[Chwinga\|Chwinga]]. Slowly scouting the perimeter with [[Hazel\|Hazel]] keeping watching from atop the gnomon and [[Azgul\|Azgul]] stepping towards the southern forest, more voices began appearing: those of hunters in need for instance. Sensing a presence behind one of the tall elvish statues, [[Azgul\|Azgul]] Eldritch Blasted through it revealing a wendigo horror. The battle was one of light and shadow with the wendigo suddenly shifting between trees and behind bodies in the dimness of the fog as [[Tetro\|Tetro]] and [[Hazel\|Hazel]] lit up the grounds with spellfire and [[Fern\|Fern]] cloaking herself in the occlusion of the twilight to strike. The party wrecked the distorted moose, which shriveled to its former form. |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/08\|08]] | #battle #TheWhiteMoose [[Ravisin\|Ravisin]] conjured a dozen wolves to attack the party. The party managed to fend for themselves while they broke the frost druid's concentration, dispelling the wolves. Ravisin wild shaped into an owl and attempted to flee, but was caught by ranged attacks and came crashing into the moon dial. Calling out to her dead sister [[Vurnis\|Vurnis]] and beseeching [[Auril\|Auril]] to witness her, she cast a maelstrom of ice onto the party and herself, ending her own life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/07\|07]] | #battle #TheWhiteMoose Three banshees, spectral female elves, surprised the party in the thick of the misty woods. The less-than-corporeal banshee resisted the party's physical onslaught. [[Old Huntsman Clive\|Old Huntsman Clive]] fell first, a banshee's phantasmal grasp bringing blood to pool in his mouth. After repeatedly being afflicted by the banshees' wails, [[Fern\|Fern]] collapsed and [[Oona\|Oona]] all but fell, relying on her orcish ancestry to keep her afoot. The party was able to thwart them in the long run, dragging their battered selves further into the wood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/06\|06]] | #battle #ABeautifulMine Several encounters unfolded in the gem mines, mostly against easily dispatched kobolds, but also against a set of grells that had preyed on weaker beings and caused significant tension in the mine. The party eventually encountered a well-spoken kobold leader with fake dragon wings named [[T-Rex\|T-Rex]], who was found out to have been possessed by the [[Ghost of Janth\|Ghost of Janth]], a sage who had succumbed to exposure on the iceplains. The kobolds had been seeking refuge and a better life, though through a lot of skullduggery. The ghost wished to infiltrate society and, while rational, had less-than-good aspirations. The ghost was exorcised. The party, tired of shenanigans, told T-Rex and two surviving kobolds to take a hike.                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/05\|05]] | #battle #MountainClimb In the darkness, they found a yeti and two smaller indistinct forms. The party took the opportunity to attack the beast and lure it out. In the following confusion, they realize a yeti tyke had been batting around [[Perilou\|Perilou]], who exhausted but unharmed, in the corner and that they were fighting the mother. As the party and [[Garret Velryn\|Garret]] dispatched the monstrosity, the father approached with a slewn goat. Putting the yetis to rest, the party decided to push for the mountain-top to look for [[Astrix\|Astrix]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/05\|05]] | #battle #MountainClimb Before they could lash up the dogs and leave, an avalanched swept through the hillside, ensnaring [[Garret Velryn\|Garret Velryn]]. Soon after, a chill wind summoned three [[Cold Light Walkers\|Cold Light Walkers]], who the party and [[Perilou\|Perilou]] dispatched.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/04\|04]] | #battle #MountainClimb Three crag cats pounced on the party. [[Garret Velryn\|Garret]] fought alongside them. These were big, mean kitties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Testing stuff (ignore)/03\|03]] | #battle #ArmoredCorps The party fought four [[Zhentarim\|Zhentarim]] thugs in a Bryn Shander alley. They got one to talk after they discovered a [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bryn Shander#The Hooked Knucklehead\|The Hooked Knucklehead]] tavern flyer on him with a note `...-.-..` on the back. It was a knocking passcode for the backdoor of the tavern, where the Zhentarim have been fencing stolen goods from the armory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
