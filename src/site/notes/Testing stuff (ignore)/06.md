> **Mine Snowball Kobolds, Enthralled and Brawled.**
## A Beautiful Mine
- (x:: #MountainClimb #TheGoldenDawn The party returned from their mountain rescue with [[Garret Velryn\|Garret Velryn]] and [[Perilou\|Perilou]] to [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine\|Termalaine]]. Having a late supper at [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine#The Blue Clam\|Termalaine#The Blue Clam]], they overheard local miners as well as hunters from [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Lonelywood\|Lonelywood]] chattering about both the kobold infestation at the local tourmaline mine as well as the bright flash of light that filled the night sky. There are some old hunting cabins that Lonelywood trappers used in those woods, though few remain in service as outposts.)
- (x:: #MountainClimb #TheGoldenDawn The party lodged at [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine#The Eastlook\|Termalaine#The Eastlook]]. The next morning they bid Garret farewell as he made plans to find a convoy heading back to [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Targos\|Targos]] so he could rejoin [[Keegan Velryn\|Keegan Velryn]]. Insightful party members noted his grim disposition, as he eyed the oncoming full moon that coincides with Targos's lottery. Perilou, on the other hand, made plans to return to the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Bryn Shander#House of the Morninglord\|Bryn Shander#House of the Morninglord]], where she engaged in religious discourse. Perilou thought she might have a lead on the cabin: her acquaintance at the House of the Morninglord, a gnome named [[Copper\|Copper]], had a wizarding friend who was said to be a recluse in the Lonelywood forests.)
- (x:: #ABeautifulMine Talking to speaker [[Oarus Masthew\|Oarus Masthew]], the party agreed on a 60g reward (fair splittings!) to tackle the mine problem. The [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine\|Termalaine]] mine descended deep into the Dale and glittered with gemdust. The place was filled with kobold tracks and signs of struggle were seen.)
- (x:: #battle #ABeautifulMine Several encounters unfolded in the gem mines, mostly against easily dispatched kobolds, but also against a set of grells that had preyed on weaker beings and caused significant tension in the mine. The party eventually encountered a well-spoken kobold leader with fake dragon wings named [[T-Rex\|T-Rex]], who was found out to have been possessed by the [[Ghost of Janth\|Ghost of Janth]], a sage who had succumbed to exposure on the iceplains. The kobolds had been seeking refuge and a better life, though through a lot of skullduggery. The ghost wished to infiltrate society and, while rational, had less-than-good aspirations. The ghost was exorcised. The party, tired of shenanigans, told T-Rex and two surviving kobolds to take a hike.)
- (x:: #ABeautifulMine #TheSignal An ancient illithid skull was found well-preserved at the base of the [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine\|Termalaine]] gem mine. Inside the skull was a Psi Crystal, which [[Tetro\|Tetro]] took and began pondering, attuning to it.)
- (x:: #ABeautifulMine At the very base of the mine was a large vein of tourmaline! The aprty set to work with pickaxes, raking in 480 gp total worth of gems, which they later traded in town.)
- (x:: #ABeautifulMine #TheWhiteMoose Upon return to [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Termalaine\|Termalaine]], [[Oarus Masthew\|Oarus Masthew]] assuaged the party to rest up for the next day on the house while he inspected the mines. In the meantime, the party heard that both [[Garret Velryn\|Garret Velryn]] and [[Perilou\|Perilou]] had departed with a passing merchant caravan - one named belonging to a [[Torg\|Torg]]. The party also overheard of troubles in [[Testing stuff (ignore)/Lonelywood\|Lonelywood]], a white moose that seems bent of slaying men.)
